# Coordinate Geometry Gradient Midpoint Line Equation

## Learning Objectives
- Calculate the gradient between two points.
- Use midpoint formula \(\bigl(\tfrac{x_1+x_2}{2},\tfrac{y_1+y_2}{2}\bigr)\).
- Determine the equation of a line in the form \(y=mx+c\).

## Key Terminology
- **Concept**: Key idea related to the topic.

## Core Explanations
Gradient is the ratio of vertical change to horizontal change. The midpoint gives the coordinates halfway between two points. Knowing the gradient and a point allows the line equation to be found using \(y-y_1=m(x-x_1)\).

## Worked Examples
1. *Find a gradient*: Calculate the gradient of the line joining \((2,3)\) and \((5,11)\).
2. *Line through two points*: Determine the equation of the line through \((1,-2)\) and \((4,7)\).
