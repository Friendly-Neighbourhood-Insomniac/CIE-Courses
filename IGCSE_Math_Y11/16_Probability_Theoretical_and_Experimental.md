# Probability Theoretical and Experimental

## Learning Objectives
- Interpret the probability scale from 0 to 1 and express probabilities as fractions, decimals or percentages.
- Calculate probabilities of single events and combined events using tree diagrams and Venn diagrams.
- Apply the addition and multiplication laws for mutually exclusive and independent events.
- Use permutations and combinations to count outcomes in probability problems.
- Use interactive simulations to reinforce understanding of concepts.

## Key Terminology
- **Outcome**: One possible result of a random experiment.
- **Sample space**: Set containing all possible outcomes of an experiment.
- **Independent events**: Two events where the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other.
- **Mutually exclusive events**: Events that cannot happen at the same time.
- **Complement**: Probability of an event not occurring, $P(A')=1-P(A)$.
- **Benchmark**: Standard or point of reference for comparison.

## Core Explanations
- Constructing sample spaces and listing outcomes for experiments such as throwing dice or selecting cards.
- Using the addition rule $P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)$ and recognising when $P(A\cap B)=0$ for exclusive events.
- Calculating conditional probability for independent events using $P(A\cap B)=P(A)P(B)$.
- Employing tree diagrams to represent sequential events and to compute probabilities along branches.
- Counting arrangements using factorial notation, $n!$, and choosing $r$ objects from $n$ with $\binom{n}{r}$.
- Apply principles in realistic contexts such as laboratory experiments.

## Worked Examples
1. *Two dice*: Find the probability that the sum of two fair six-sided dice is 8.
   - Favourable pairs: (2,6), (3,5), (4,4), (5,3), (6,2); 5 outcomes out of 36 total so $P=5/36$.
2. *Card selection*: From a standard deck, what is the probability of drawing a heart or a king?
   - $P(\text{heart})=13/52$, $P(\text{king})=4/52$, $P(\text{heart} \cap \text{king})=1/52$. So $P=\tfrac{13}{52}+\tfrac{4}{52}-\tfrac{1}{52}=\tfrac{16}{52}=\tfrac{4}{13}$.
3. *Permutation problem*: How many ways can the letters of the word “PROB” be arranged? What is the probability that a random arrangement begins with P?
   - There are $4!=24$ total arrangements. Those beginning with P have $3!=6$, so probability $6/24=1/4$.

4. *Practice problem*: Use this problem to check your understanding of the theory.
   - Solution steps should include reasoning and final answer with units.

## Exam Tips
- Check if events are independent or mutually exclusive before applying rules; highlight this in working.
- When using tree diagrams, ensure probabilities along each branch multiply to give the outcome probability.
- Double-check that probabilities in a complete sample space add up to 1.
- Review past papers to identify common question patterns.

## Common Pitfalls
- Forgetting to subtract overlaps when events are not mutually exclusive.
- Mixing up permutations (order matters) with combinations (order does not matter).
- Rounding intermediate probability values when exact fractions would be simpler.
- Overlooking units when substituting values into formulas.
