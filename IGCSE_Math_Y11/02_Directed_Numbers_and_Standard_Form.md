# Directed Numbers And Standard Form

## Learning Objectives
- Perform arithmetic operations with positive and negative numbers.
- Convert between ordinary numbers and standard form \(a \times 10^n\).
- Multiply and divide numbers expressed in standard form.

## Key Terminology
- **Concept**: Key idea related to the topic.

## Core Explanations
Directed numbers follow sign rules for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.  Standard form expresses numbers as \(a \times 10^n\) where \(1\le a<10\) and \(n\) is an integer.  Calculations with standard form often require use of index laws and a calculator.

## Worked Examples
1. *Standard form calculation*: Express \(-4500\) in standard form and multiply by \(3\times10^4\).
2. *Directed number word problem*: Evaluate \(-8-(-3)\times5\) showing all steps.
