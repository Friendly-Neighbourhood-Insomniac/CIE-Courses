# Geometry and Trigonometry

## Learning Objectives
- Solve geometric problems involving angles, polygons, circles, and loci.
- Apply Pythagoras' theorem, trigonometric ratios, and area formulas in right and non-right triangles.
- Use the sine rule, cosine rule, and area formula $\tfrac{1}{2}ab\sin C$ in any triangle.
- Demonstrate understanding of similarity and congruence in two-dimensional figures.

## Key Terminology
- **Congruent**: Figures that are identical in shape and size.
- **Hypotenuse**: Longest side of a right-angled triangle opposite the right angle.
- **Sine rule**: $\frac{a}{\sin A}=\frac{b}{\sin B}=\frac{c}{\sin C}$; relates sides and angles in any triangle.
- **Cosine rule**: $c^2=a^2+b^2-2ab\cos C$ used to find unknown sides or angles.
- **Tangent**: Ratio of opposite to adjacent side in a right triangle, $\tan\theta=\frac{\text{opp}}{\text{adj}}$.

## Core Explanations
- Properties of parallel lines cut by a transversal: alternate, corresponding, and interior angles.
- Conditions for similarity (AAA, SAS, SSS) and for congruence (SSS, SAS, ASA, RHS).
- Using Pythagoras' theorem for distance problems in coordinate geometry and simple 3-D contexts.
- Trigonometric ratios (sine, cosine, tangent) to find missing sides and angles; solving word problems involving bearings and heights.
- Circumference and area of circles, arcs, and sectors, including radian measure for angles.

## Worked Examples
1. *Cosine rule*: In triangle ABC with $a=7$, $b=9$, and angle $C=120°$, find side $c$.
   - $c^2=7^2+9^2-2\times7\times9\cos120°=49+81+63=193$ so $c\approx13.9$.
2. *Angle of elevation*: From a point 50 m from a tower, the top is seen at 38°. Find the height of the tower.
   - $h=50\tan38°\approx39\,\text{m}$.
3. *Area using trig*: Calculate the area of a triangle with sides 5 cm and 7 cm including an angle of 40°.
   - $A=\tfrac{1}{2}ab\sin C=\tfrac{1}{2}\times5\times7\sin40°\approx11.2\,\text{cm}^2$.

## Exam Tips
- Draw diagrams to scale where possible and label all known sides and angles.
- Check that calculators are set to degrees when solving exam questions unless radians are required.
- Use three significant figures for final answers unless told otherwise.

## Common Pitfalls
- Mixing up opposite, adjacent and hypotenuse when using sine, cosine or tangent.
- Rounding intermediate values too early, leading to inaccurate final answers.
- Forgetting that arcs and sectors require angles in radians when using $s=r\theta$ or $A=\tfrac{1}{2}r^2\theta$.
