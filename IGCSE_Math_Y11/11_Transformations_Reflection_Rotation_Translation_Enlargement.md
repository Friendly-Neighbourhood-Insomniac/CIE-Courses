# Transformations Reflection Rotation Translation Enlargement

## Learning Objectives
- Describe reflections, rotations, translations and enlargements using coordinates.
- Use matrices to represent these transformations.
- Combine successive transformations and determine their overall effect.

## Key Terminology
- **Concept**: Key idea related to the topic.

## Core Explanations
A reflection in the x-axis changes \((x,y)\) to \((x,-y)\); rotations are defined by a centre and angle; translations move points by a vector \(\begin{pmatrix}a\\b\end{pmatrix}\); and enlargements scale distances from a centre by a scale factor.  Matrices provide a concise representation.

## Worked Examples
1. *Matrix transformation*: Apply a rotation matrix to \((1,0)\) and state the new coordinates.
2. *Combination*: Perform a reflection in the y-axis followed by a translation by \((3,-1)\).
