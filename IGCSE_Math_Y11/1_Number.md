# Number

## Learning Objectives
- Use numerical notation including integers, fractions, decimals and percentages.
- Apply the four basic operations with directed numbers and check results using estimation.
- Convert between fractions, decimals, percentages and express numbers in standard form.
- Round values appropriately using significant figures or decimal places in context.
- Use interactive simulations to reinforce understanding of concepts.

## Key Terminology
- **Integer**: Positive, negative or zero whole number with no fractional part.
- **Prime number**: A whole number greater than 1 with exactly two distinct factors, 1 and itself.
- **Percentage**: A proportion expressed out of 100.
- **Standard form**: A number written as $a\times10^n$ where $1\le a<10$ and $n$ is an integer.
- **Directed number**: Number that includes a sign, indicating positive or negative value.
- **Benchmark**: Standard or point of reference for comparison.

## Core Explanations
- Ordering rational numbers on the number line and comparing magnitudes.
- Performing arithmetic with fractions, including conversion between mixed numbers and improper fractions.
- Working with powers and roots, including squares, cubes, reciprocals and use of calculators for fractional indices.
- Using ratio and proportion to solve problems such as currency conversions and map scales.
- Interpreting recurring decimals and writing them as fractions.
- Apply principles in realistic contexts such as laboratory experiments.

## Worked Examples
1. *Percentage increase*: Increase 120 by 15% and write the result to 3 significant figures.
   - $120\times1.15=138$ exactly; to 3 s.f. the answer is 138.
2. *Standard form*: Express 0.00032 in standard form and state the order of magnitude.
   - $3.2\times10^{-4}$; order of magnitude $10^{-4}$.
3. *Fraction to decimal*: Convert $\tfrac{7}{8}$ to a decimal.
   - $7\div8=0.875$.
4. *Ratio simplification*: Simplify the ratio 150:60.
   - Divide by 30 to get $5:2$.

5. *Practice problem*: Use this problem to check your understanding of the theory.
   - Solution steps should include reasoning and final answer with units.

## Exam Tips
- Write the units in currency or measurement problems and pay attention to rounding instructions.
- Use prime factorisation for finding highest common factor (HCF) or lowest common multiple (LCM).
- Check approximate answers to avoid calculator mistakes.
- Review past papers to identify common question patterns.

## Common Pitfalls
- Mixing up denominators when adding or subtracting fractions.
- Forgetting to convert percentage to a decimal (divide by 100) before multiplying.
- Leaving answers in calculator form rather than simplified fractions or decimals.
- Overlooking units when substituting values into formulas.
