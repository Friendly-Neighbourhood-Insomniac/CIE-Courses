# Vectors Representation And Calculations

## Learning Objectives
- Represent vectors using column notation or \(i, j\) components.
- Calculate magnitude and direction of a vector.
- Add, subtract and multiply vectors by scalars in geometric problems.

## Key Terminology
- **Concept**: Key idea related to the topic.

## Core Explanations
A vector \(\mathbf{a}=\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\end{pmatrix}\) has magnitude \(|\mathbf{a}|=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\) and direction given by \(\tan\theta=\tfrac{y}{x}\).  Vectors can represent displacements or forces and obey triangle rules for addition.

## Worked Examples
1. *Resultant vector*: Find \(3\mathbf{i}+4\mathbf{j}+(-\mathbf{i}+2\mathbf{j})\).
2. *Magnitude and direction*: Calculate the length and bearing of \(\begin{pmatrix}5\\-2\end{pmatrix}\).
