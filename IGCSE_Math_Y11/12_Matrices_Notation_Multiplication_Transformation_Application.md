# Matrices Notation Multiplication Transformation Application

## Learning Objectives
- Understand matrix notation and order.
- Multiply 2\times2 matrices and use them for transformations.
- Apply matrices to solve simple linear equations.

## Key Terminology
- **Concept**: Key idea related to the topic.

## Core Explanations
Matrices represent linear transformations such as rotations and reflections.  Multiplication combines transformations.  The identity matrix leaves vectors unchanged, while the inverse matrix reverses a transformation when it exists.

## Worked Examples
1. *Matrix multiplication*: Multiply \(\begin{pmatrix}1&2\\0&1\end{pmatrix}\) by \(\begin{pmatrix}3\\4\end{pmatrix}\).
2. *Inverse matrix*: Use a 2\times2 matrix to represent a reflection and find its inverse.
