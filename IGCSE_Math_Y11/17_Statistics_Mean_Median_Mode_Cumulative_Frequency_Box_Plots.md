# Statistics Mean Median Mode Cumulative Frequency Box Plots

## Learning Objectives
- Collect, classify and tabulate raw data for statistical analysis.
- Display data in appropriate forms such as bar charts, histograms, pie charts and scatter diagrams.
- Calculate and interpret measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of spread (range, interquartile range, standard deviation).
- Use cumulative frequency curves and box-and-whisker plots to summarise distributions and estimate percentiles.
- Use interactive simulations to reinforce understanding of concepts.

## Key Terminology
- **Mean**: Sum of all data values divided by the number of values.
- **Median**: Middle value when the data are arranged in numerical order.
- **Interquartile range**: Difference between the upper quartile ($Q_3$) and lower quartile ($Q_1$).
- **Standard deviation**: Measure of the dispersion of data around the mean.
- **Frequency density**: Frequency divided by class width in a histogram.
- **Benchmark**: Standard or point of reference for comparison.

## Core Explanations
- Organising data into frequency tables and drawing histograms for continuous data with unequal class widths.
- Calculating the mean from a frequency table using the midpoints of the classes.
- Creating cumulative frequency tables and curves to find medians, quartiles and percentiles.
- Interpreting scatter diagrams to identify correlation and line of best fit.
- Constructing box-and-whisker plots to compare distributions in terms of spread and skewness.
- Apply principles in realistic contexts such as laboratory experiments.

## Worked Examples
1. *Grouped data mean*: Given the frequency table with class 0–10 (frequency 3), 10–20 (frequency 7) and 20–30 (frequency 10), estimate the mean.
   - Midpoints: 5, 15, 25. Mean $=\frac{3\times5+7\times15+10\times25}{3+7+10}=19.0$.
2. *Box plot interpretation*: A box plot shows $Q_1=40$, $Q_3=70$, median = 55, min = 30 and max = 80. Comment on the spread.
   - The interquartile range is 30 and the data are slightly skewed towards the lower end since the whisker below $Q_1$ is longer.
3. *Standard deviation*: For data set 2, 4, 4, 7, 9, calculate the standard deviation.
   - Mean = 5.2; using formula $\sqrt{\tfrac{\sum(x-\bar{x})^2}{n}}$, the standard deviation is approximately 2.7.

4. *Practice problem*: Use this problem to check your understanding of the theory.
   - Solution steps should include reasoning and final answer with units.

## Exam Tips
- Label axes clearly and choose suitable scales for frequency diagrams and histograms.
- When estimating from grouped data, use class midpoints and include working.
- Check for outliers and mention them if interpreting box-and-whisker plots.
- Review past papers to identify common question patterns.

## Common Pitfalls
- Confusing frequency with cumulative frequency on graphs.
- Forgetting to sort data before identifying the median or quartiles.
- Miscalculating class width when drawing histograms with unequal intervals.
- Overlooking units when substituting values into formulas.
