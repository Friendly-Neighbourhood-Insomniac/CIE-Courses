# Algebra Solving Linear Simultaneous and Quadratic Equations

## Learning Objectives
- Manipulate algebraic expressions using the laws of indices and factorisation.
- Solve linear and quadratic equations, including simultaneous and word problems.
- Plot and interpret graphs of linear and quadratic functions.
- Formulate algebraic expressions from real-life situations and use inequalities to represent constraints.
- Use interactive simulations to reinforce understanding of concepts.

## Key Terminology
- **Coefficient**: Numerical factor multiplying a variable in a term.
- **Quadratic**: Polynomial expression in the form $ax^2+bx+c$ with $a\ne0$.
- **Factorisation**: Process of expressing an algebraic expression as a product of its factors.
- **Simultaneous equations**: Set of equations solved together because they share variables.
- **Inequality**: Mathematical statement comparing expressions using <, >, ≤, or ≥.
- **Benchmark**: Standard or point of reference for comparison.

## Core Explanations
- Expanding double brackets, using the distributive law, and factorising by grouping or using the difference of two squares.
- Solving quadratic equations by factorisation, completing the square, and the quadratic formula.
- Interpreting the features of quadratic graphs: vertex, axis of symmetry, and roots.
- Translating word problems into algebraic equations and inequalities, such as cost or distance problems.
- Rearranging algebraic formulae to make a given variable the subject.
- Apply principles in realistic contexts such as laboratory experiments.

## Worked Examples
1. *Quadratic roots*: Solve $2x^2-3x-2=0$.
   - Using the quadratic formula: $x=\frac{3\pm\sqrt{9+16}}{4}=\frac{3\pm5}{4}$ giving $x=2$ or $x=-\tfrac{1}{2}$.
2. *Simultaneous equations*: Solve $\begin{cases}2x+y=7\\x-y=1\end{cases}$.
   - Adding gives $3x=8$, so $x=\tfrac{8}{3}$; substitute back to find $y=\tfrac{5}{3}$.
3. *Inequality*: Write and solve an inequality for the statement "the square of a number is less than 5 times the number".
   - Let $x$ be the number: $x^2<5x \Rightarrow x^2-5x<0 \Rightarrow x(x-5)<0$ giving $0<x<5$.

4. *Practice problem*: Use this problem to check your understanding of the theory.
   - Solution steps should include reasoning and final answer with units.

## Exam Tips
- Always check for a common factor before using the quadratic formula or other methods.
- When manipulating inequalities, reverse the inequality sign when multiplying or dividing by a negative number.
- Clearly label the axes and intercepts when sketching graphs.
- Review past papers to identify common question patterns.

## Common Pitfalls
- Losing the negative sign when expanding brackets like $(x-3)(x+2)$.
- Writing only one root when a quadratic has two valid solutions.
- Misinterpreting a word problem and forming the wrong equation.
- Overlooking units when substituting values into formulas.
