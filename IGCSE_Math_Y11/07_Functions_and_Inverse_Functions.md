# Functions and Inverse Functions

## Learning Objectives
- Interpret function notation such as \(f(x)\) and evaluate functions for given inputs.
- Find and use inverse functions algebraically and graphically.
- Sketch a function and its inverse on the same axes.

## Key Terminology
- **Concept**: Key idea related to the topic.

## Core Explanations
A function maps each input to one output.  The inverse function reverses this process, provided the original function is one-to-one.  On a graph, the inverse is a reflection in the line \(y=x\).

## Worked Examples
1. *Finding an inverse*: If \(f(x)=3x-5\), determine \(f^{-1}(x)\) and verify the composition.
2. *Graph sketch*: Plot \(y=x^2\) for \(x\ge0\) and its inverse on the same diagram.
