# Waves

## Learning Objectives
- Distinguish between transverse and longitudinal waves with examples.
- Use the terms wavelength, frequency, period, amplitude, and wave speed accurately.
- Apply the relationship $v=f\lambda$ and solve problems using the wave equation.
- Describe reflection, refraction, diffraction and interference phenomena.
- Use interactive simulations to reinforce understanding of concepts.

## Key Terminology
- **Wavelength ($\lambda$)**: Distance between two consecutive points in phase, e.g. crest to crest.
- **Frequency ($f$)**: Number of complete waves passing a point in one second.
- **Amplitude**: Maximum displacement of a point on the wave from its rest position.
- **Period ($T$)**: Time taken for one complete oscillation ($T=1/f$).
- **Wavefront**: Line representing points on a wave that are in phase.
- **Benchmark**: Standard or point of reference for comparison.

## Core Explanations
- Differentiating transverse waves (vibration perpendicular to direction of travel) from longitudinal waves (vibration parallel to direction of travel).
- Using ripple tank experiments to illustrate reflection from boundaries and diffraction at gaps.
- Refraction as a change in wave speed when entering a new medium, leading to a change of direction.
- Superposition of waves leading to constructive and destructive interference patterns.
- Apply principles in realistic contexts such as laboratory experiments.

## Worked Examples
1. *Wave equation*: A sound wave of frequency 256 Hz travels at 340 m/s. Determine its wavelength.
   - $\lambda=\frac{v}{f}=\frac{340}{256}=1.33\,\text{m}$.
2. *Refraction at a boundary*: Light travels from air ($n\approx1.0$) into glass ($n=1.5$) at 30° to the normal. Calculate the angle in glass.
   - $n_1\sin\theta_1=n_2\sin\theta_2 \Rightarrow \sin\theta_2=\frac{1.0\sin30°}{1.5}=0.333 \Rightarrow \theta_2\approx19.5°$.
3. *Interference pattern spacing*: Two slits are 0.50 mm apart and illuminated with light of wavelength 600 nm on a screen 2 m away. Find the fringe spacing.
   - $\Delta y=\frac{\lambda D}{d}=\frac{6\times10^{-7}\times2}{5\times10^{-4}}=2.4\times10^{-3}\,\text{m}$.

4. *Practice problem*: Use this problem to check your understanding of the theory.
   - Solution steps should include reasoning and final answer with units.

## Exam Tips
- Always label diagrams with incident ray, reflected ray, normal, angle of incidence, and angle of refraction.
- State units when calculating wavelength or frequency.
- Mention that diffraction effects become more pronounced when the gap size is comparable to wavelength.
- Review past papers to identify common question patterns.

## Common Pitfalls
- Mixing up frequency and period when substituting values.
- Forgetting that wave speed changes, not frequency, when a wave refracts.
- Drawing wavefront diagrams without indicating the direction of propagation.
- Overlooking units when substituting values into formulas.
