# Electricity and Magnetism

## Learning Objectives
- Describe electric charge and current in terms of electron flow.
- Use potential difference, resistance, and Ohm's law in circuit calculations.
- Analyse the behaviour of series and parallel circuits including resistors and lamps.
- Explain magnetic fields produced by currents and the principles of electromagnetic induction.

## Key Terminology
- **Current ($I$)**: Rate of flow of charge, measured in amperes (A).
- **Voltage ($V$)**: Work done per unit charge moving between two points.
- **Resistance ($R$)**: Ratio of potential difference to current in a component.
- **Magnetic field**: Region where magnetic forces act on moving charges or magnetic materials.
- **Electromotive force (emf)**: Energy supplied per coulomb by a source such as a battery.

## Core Explanations
- Conductors and insulators, conventional current direction versus electron flow.
- Calculation of total resistance in series ($R_T=R_1+R_2+\dots$) and parallel ($\frac{1}{R_T}=\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}+\dots$) arrangements.
- Energy and power in electrical circuits using $P=IV$ and $E=Pt$.
- Magnetic effects of a current-carrying wire, solenoid fields, and applications such as relays and electromagnets.
- Induced emf generated when magnetic flux through a coil changes (Faraday's law and Lenz's law).

## Worked Examples
1. *Resistor calculation*: A 12 V supply produces a current of 2 A through a resistor. Determine its resistance and the power dissipated.
   - $R=\frac{V}{I}=6\,\Omega;\ P=VI=24\,\text{W}$.
2. *Parallel circuit*: Two resistors of 6 \(\Omega\) and 12 \(\Omega\) are connected in parallel. Find the combined resistance.
   - $\frac{1}{R_T}=\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{12}=\frac{1}{4} \Rightarrow R_T=4\,\Omega$.
3. *Induced voltage*: A coil with 50 turns experiences a change in magnetic flux of 0.02 Wb in 0.1 s. Calculate the induced emf.
   - $\text{emf}=\frac{N\Delta\Phi}{\Delta t}=\frac{50\times0.02}{0.1}=10\,\text{V}$.

## Exam Tips
- Use correct circuit symbols and indicate the direction of conventional current.
- When solving power problems, convert units to the standard SI forms (volts, amperes, ohms, watts).
- In electromagnetism questions, state the direction of force or induced current using the right-hand or Fleming rules.

## Common Pitfalls
- Mixing up series and parallel formulae for resistance and current.
- Assuming the voltage is the same across each resistor in seriesâ€”it is the current that remains the same.
- Forgetting that induced emf opposes the change causing it (Lenz's law).
