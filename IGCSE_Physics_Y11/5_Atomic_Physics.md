# Atomic Physics

## Learning Objectives
- Describe the structure of atoms in terms of nuclei and orbiting electrons.
- Explain the nature of radioactive decay and distinguish between alpha, beta, and gamma radiation.
- Perform calculations involving half-life, activity, and nuclear equations.
- Discuss uses and hazards of ionising radiation and outline the principles of nuclear energy production.
- Use interactive simulations to reinforce understanding of concepts.

## Key Terminology
- **Isotope**: Atoms of the same element that contain different numbers of neutrons.
- **Radioactivity**: Spontaneous emission of ionising radiation from unstable nuclei.
- **Half-life**: Time required for half the nuclei in a radioactive sample to decay.
- **Activity**: Rate of decay of a radioactive source, measured in becquerels (Bq).
- **Nuclear fission**: Splitting of a heavy nucleus into lighter nuclei, releasing energy.
- **Benchmark**: Standard or point of reference for comparison.

## Core Explanations
- Modern atomic model: small dense nucleus containing protons and neutrons surrounded by electrons in shells.
- Comparison of alpha, beta, and gamma radiation in terms of charge, mass, penetration and ionising ability.
- Balancing nuclear equations with conservation of mass number and atomic number.
- Half-life graphs showing exponential decay and calculations using $N=N_0(1/2)^{t/T_{1/2}}$.
- Outline of nuclear power generation: controlled fission chain reaction, moderators, control rods, and safety measures.
- Apply principles in realistic contexts such as laboratory experiments.

## Worked Examples
1. *Half-life problem*: A sample shows an activity of 80 Bq. After 12 hours it is 20 Bq. Find the half-life.
   - Activity has halved twice (80 → 40 → 20), so 12 hours corresponds to two half-lives. Half-life = 6 hours.
2. *Balancing equations*: Write the nuclear equation for beta-minus decay of carbon-14.
   - $^{14}_{6}\text{C}\rightarrow^{14}_{7}\text{N}+\beta^-+\bar{\nu}_e$.
3. *Energy from fission*: If 1 kg of uranium-235 releases $8\times10^{13}$ J when fissioned, calculate the mass-energy conversion per atom.
   - $E=mc^2 \Rightarrow m=E/c^2$. Per atom, energy is $(8\times10^{13})/N_A$ where $N_A$ is Avogadro's number.

4. *Practice problem*: Use this problem to check your understanding of the theory.
   - Solution steps should include reasoning and final answer with units.

## Exam Tips
- Show all steps when calculating half-life from graphs or data tables.
- Remember to balance both mass and proton numbers in nuclear equations.
- Mention appropriate precautions when handling radioactive materials.
- Review past papers to identify common question patterns.

## Common Pitfalls
- Confusing the meanings of activity and half-life—they are related but distinct.
- Forgetting that gamma radiation has no mass or charge but contributes to dose.
- Mixing up nuclear fission (splitting heavy nuclei) and fusion (combining light nuclei).
- Overlooking units when substituting values into formulas.
