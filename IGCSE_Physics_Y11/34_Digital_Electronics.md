# Digital Electronics

## Learning Objectives
- Understand binary states and logic gates.
- Draw truth tables for AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR.
- Recognize simple logic circuits in devices.

## Key Terminology
- **Concept**: Key idea related to the topic.

## Core Explanations
Digital circuits operate using two voltage levels representing 0 and 1. Combining logic gates allows construction of circuits that perform functions such as switching and memory. Truth tables summarise the output for all input combinations.

## Worked Examples
1. *Truth table*: Produce the truth table for an AND gate followed by a NOT gate.
2. *Logic design*: Design a simple alarm circuit that triggers when two switches are closed.

## Exam Tips
- Check units carefully when substituting numbers into equations.
- Show intermediate steps to gain method marks.

## Common Pitfalls
- Misreading the question or forgetting to convert units can cause errors.
