# Static Electricity Charging By Friction Dangers

## Learning Objectives
- Describe charging by friction and by induction.
- Explain electric field lines and sparks.
- Identify safety measures for static electricity.

## Key Terminology
- **Concept**: Key idea related to the topic.

## Core Explanations
When certain materials rub together, electrons are transferred creating positive and negative charges. Charged objects experience forces and can discharge with a spark if the potential difference becomes large. Static build-up can be dangerous near flammable gases.

## Worked Examples
1. *Balloon rubbing*: Describe and explain the charging of a balloon rubbed on hair.
2. *Fuel tanker*: Suggest methods to prevent static sparks when refuelling aircraft.
