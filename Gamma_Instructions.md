# Using These Lessons with Gamma

These markdown files are designed for import into [Gamma](https://gamma.app) to automatically generate interactive lesson presentations.

## Presentation Workflow
- Upload a lesson `.md` file to Gamma.
- Each level 1 heading `#` becomes the slide title.
- Bullet lists under headings are converted into slide points or cards.
- Images and iframe embeds are preserved for interactive elements.

## Style Guidelines
- Keep points short for readability on slides.
- Include equations using LaTeX syntax where needed.
- Use `##` or `###` headings to break larger topics into multiple slides.
- Ensure links and iframe embeds have short descriptive text for accessibility.

## Additional AI Instructions
- Summarize bullet sections concisely to create visually engaging slides.
- Maintain alignment with the CIE syllabus for every course.
- Suggest relevant simulations or videos whenever applicable.

Gamma will interpret the structured sections to produce a clean presentation for each module.
