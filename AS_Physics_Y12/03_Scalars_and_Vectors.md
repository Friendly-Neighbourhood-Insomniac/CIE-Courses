# Scalars and Vectors

## Learning Objectives
- Distinguish between scalar and vector quantities with examples.
- Add vectors graphically and by components.
- Resolve vectors into perpendicular components for problem solving.

## Key Terminology
- **Concept**: Key idea related to the topic.

## Core Explanations
Scalars have magnitude only, while vectors include direction.  Vector addition can be performed using triangle or parallelogram methods.  Components along axes simplify the analysis of forces and velocities.

## Worked Examples
1. *Component method*: Resolve a 10 N force acting at 30Â° to the horizontal into horizontal and vertical components.
2. *Vector addition*: Find the resultant of two displacement vectors given in i, j notation.

## Exam Tips
- Check units carefully when substituting numbers into equations.
- Show intermediate steps to gain method marks.

## Common Pitfalls
- Misreading the question or forgetting to convert units can cause errors.
