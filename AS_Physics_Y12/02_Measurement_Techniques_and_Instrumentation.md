# Measurement Techniques and Instrumentation

## Learning Objectives
- Use vernier calipers and micrometers to make precise length measurements.
- Calibrate sensors and discuss systematic and random errors.
- Quote readings with appropriate significant figures and uncertainties.

## Key Terminology
- **Concept**: Key idea related to the topic.

## Core Explanations
Accurate measurements rely on correctly zeroing instruments and estimating the smallest scale division.  Uncertainties are expressed as absolute or percentage values.  Calibration curves allow non-linear instruments to be used over a range.

## Worked Examples
1. *Using a micrometer*: Measure the diameter of a wire and state its uncertainty.
2. *Calibration exercise*: Plot a calibration curve for a thermistor and use it to determine an unknown temperature.

## Exam Tips
- Check units carefully when substituting numbers into equations.
- Show intermediate steps to gain method marks.

## Common Pitfalls
- Misreading the question or forgetting to convert units can cause errors.
