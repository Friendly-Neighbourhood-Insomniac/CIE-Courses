# Matter

## Learning Objectives
- Describe the deformation of solids and distinguish between elastic and plastic behaviour.
- Define and use stress, strain and Young modulus when analysing stretching and compression.
- Calculate density and pressure in solids, liquids and gases, and apply Archimedes' principle.
- Relate microscopic structure to macroscopic properties such as tensile strength and fluid pressure.

## Key Terminology
- **Stress**: Force per unit cross-sectional area within a material ($\sigma=F/A$).
- **Strain**: Fractional change in length ($\epsilon=\Delta L/L$) due to an applied force.
- **Young modulus ($E$)**: Ratio of stress to strain within the proportional region of deformation.
- **Elastic limit**: Point beyond which permanent deformation occurs when a force is removed.
- **Upthrust**: Upward buoyant force acting on a body submerged in a fluid.

## Core Explanations
- Hooke's law ($F=kx$) for springs, linear region on a force–extension graph and the meaning of spring constant $k$.
- Experimental determination of Young modulus using gradient of a stress–strain graph and measurements of original length and area.
- Hydrostatic pressure in a fluid given by $p=\rho gh$ and how it increases with depth.
- Density calculations $\rho=m/V$ for regular and irregular objects using displacement methods.
- Archimedes' principle explaining floating and sinking, relating upthrust to the weight of displaced fluid.

## Worked Examples
1. *Elastic extension*: A 0.5 m wire stretches 2 mm under a 10 N load. Calculate the strain and stress if the wire has cross-sectional area 1 mm².
   - Strain $\epsilon=0.002/0.5=0.004$. Stress $\sigma=10/(1\times10^{-6})=10\,\text{MPa}$.
2. *Young modulus*: Using the values above, determine the Young modulus of the wire.
   - $E=\sigma/\epsilon=10\times10^6/0.004=2.5\times10^9\,\text{Pa}$.
3. *Pressure in a liquid*: Find the pressure 5 m below the surface of water (density 1000 kg/m³).
   - $p=\rho gh=1000\times9.8\times5=4.9\times10^4\,\text{Pa}$.

## Exam Tips
- Plot stress–strain graphs carefully and use the gradient in the linear region to find Young modulus.
- When dealing with pressure in fluids, state assumptions such as constant density or incompressible fluid.
- Use SI units consistently (Pa for pressure, N for force, m for length).

## Common Pitfalls
- Confusing stress with strain or mixing their units (Pa vs dimensionless).
- Not converting area into square metres when computing stress.
- Ignoring atmospheric pressure when comparing absolute and gauge pressures.
