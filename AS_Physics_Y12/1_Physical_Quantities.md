# Physical Quantities and Units

## Learning Objectives
- Recognise the base quantities and their corresponding SI units and symbols.
- Use derived units expressed in terms of base units and apply unit conversions.
- Work confidently with prefixes from pico to giga and express orders of magnitude in standard form.
- Estimate and combine uncertainties in measurements, propagating them through calculations.

## Key Terminology
- **Base unit**: One of the fundamental units in the SI system such as metre (m) or kilogram (kg).
- **Derived unit**: A unit obtained from combinations of base units, for example the newton (N) or joule (J).
- **Uncertainty**: The estimated range within which the true value of a measured quantity lies.
- **Systematic error**: A consistent bias affecting all measurements in the same way.
- **Random error**: Variation in measurements caused by uncontrolled factors, reduced by repeated readings.

## Core Explanations
- Writing physical quantities as a numerical value multiplied by an appropriate unit and prefix.
- Converting units by multiplying by powers of ten, e.g. mm to m or kN to N.
- Expressing results with correct significant figures, typically matching the least precise measurement used.
- Propagation of absolute and fractional uncertainties when quantities are added, multiplied or raised to powers.
- Using logarithms to compare orders of magnitude and expressing very large/small values in standard form.

## Worked Examples
1. *Combined uncertainties*: A length $L=20.0\pm0.1$ cm and width $W=15.0\pm0.2$ cm are measured. Calculate the area and its percentage uncertainty.
   - Area $A=LW=300\,\text{cm}^2$; fractional uncertainty $=\tfrac{0.1}{20}+\tfrac{0.2}{15}=0.0167$ giving percentage uncertainty $1.67\%$.
2. *Prefix conversion*: Express a mass of 3.2 mg in kilograms.
   - $3.2\times10^{-3}\,\text{g}=3.2\times10^{-6}\,\text{kg}$.
3. *Order of magnitude*: Compare the size of an atom (radius $1\times10^{-10}$ m) with the size of a typical human (height $1.7$ m).
   - Difference in order of magnitude is about $10^{10}$, meaning the human is ten billion times larger.

## Exam Tips
- Always write the symbol of the unit after the numerical answer and check conversions carefully.
- Keep extra significant figures through intermediate steps, rounding only at the final answer.
- Quote uncertainties to one significant figure and match decimal places with the measurement.

## Common Pitfalls
- Mixing prefixes such as writing kJ when kW is required, or forgetting to convert time units from minutes to seconds.
- Rounding too early, which can lead to incorrect final answers when combining measurements.
- Neglecting systematic errors in experiments, which cannot be reduced simply by repeating measurements.
