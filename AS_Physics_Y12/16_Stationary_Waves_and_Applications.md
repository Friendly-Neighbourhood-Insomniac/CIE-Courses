# Stationary Waves and Applications

## Learning Objectives
- Explain the characteristics of progressive waves including wavefront, phase and energy transfer.
- Apply the principle of superposition to analyse interference, diffraction and standing waves.
- Use the equations for wave speed, frequency and wavelength in a variety of contexts.
- Describe the formation of stationary waves in strings and air columns and calculate resonant frequencies.
- Use interactive simulations to reinforce understanding of concepts.

## Key Terminology
- **Phase**: Fraction of a wave cycle relative to a reference point, often expressed in degrees or radians.
- **Interference**: Combination of two or more waves resulting in a new wave pattern with regions of constructive and destructive overlap.
- **Diffraction**: Spreading of waves as they pass through a narrow opening or around an obstacle.
- **Node**: Point of zero displacement in a standing wave.
- **Antinode**: Point of maximum displacement in a standing wave.
- **Benchmark**: Standard or point of reference for comparison.

## Core Explanations
- Derivation of the wave equation $v=f\lambda$ and understanding that frequency remains constant when a wave changes medium.
- Conditions for constructive interference ($\Delta\phi=2\pi m$) and destructive interference ($\Delta\phi=(2m+1)\pi$) in terms of path difference.
- Explanation of stationary waves as the superposition of two waves of equal amplitude traveling in opposite directions.
- Resonance in closed and open tubes: fundamental and harmonic frequencies determined by boundary conditions.
- Diffraction grating formula $d\sin\theta=m\lambda$ for determining wavelengths of light.
- Apply principles in realistic contexts such as laboratory experiments.

## Worked Examples
1. *Double-slit interference*: Calculate the fringe spacing when light of wavelength 600 nm passes through slits 0.5 mm apart onto a screen 1 m away.
   - $x=\tfrac{\lambda D}{d}=\tfrac{600\times10^{-9}\times1}{5\times10^{-4}}=1.2\times10^{-3}$ m.
2. *Standing wave on a string*: Determine the fundamental frequency of a string 0.8 m long with wave speed 160 m/s.
   - $f_1=\tfrac{v}{2L}=\tfrac{160}{1.6}=100$ Hz.
3. *Diffraction grating*: A grating has 500 lines/mm. Light produces a first-order maximum at 20°. Find the wavelength.
   - $d=1/(500\times10^3)$ m, so $\lambda=d\sin\theta=2\times10^{-6}\sin20°\approx6.8\times10^{-7}$ m (680 nm).

4. *Practice problem*: Use this problem to check your understanding of the theory.
   - Solution steps should include reasoning and final answer with units.

## Exam Tips
- Include phase difference or path difference in explanations of interference patterns.
- Label nodes and antinodes when drawing stationary waves in strings or pipes.
- Keep wavelength units consistent (use metres in calculations).
- Review past papers to identify common question patterns.

## Common Pitfalls
- Confusing frequency with angular frequency in wave equations.
- Mixing up phase difference with path difference; remember $\Delta\phi=2\pi\Delta x/\lambda$.
- Forgetting that in a stationary wave, there is no net energy transfer.
- Overlooking units when substituting values into formulas.
