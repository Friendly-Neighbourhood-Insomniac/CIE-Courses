# Experimental Skills and Data Analysis

## Learning Objectives
- Plan experiments identifying independent, dependent and control variables.
- Draw best-fit lines and determine gradients with uncertainty.
- Evaluate reliability of data using repeats and percentage error calculations.

## Key Terminology
- **Concept**: Key idea related to the topic.

## Core Explanations
Good experimental technique requires systematic recording of data and awareness of sources of error. When plotting graphs, uncertainties in gradient can be estimated using steepest and least steep lines. Percentage error compares experimental values with accepted ones.

## Worked Examples
1. *Gradient and uncertainty*: From an experimental \(I\)-\(V\) graph, determine resistance and its percentage uncertainty.
2. *Error analysis*: Calculate percentage error in density from repeated measurements of mass and volume.

## Exam Tips
- Check units carefully when substituting numbers into equations.
- Show intermediate steps to gain method marks.

## Common Pitfalls
- Misreading the question or forgetting to convert units can cause errors.
