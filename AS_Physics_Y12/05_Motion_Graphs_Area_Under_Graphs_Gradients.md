# Motion Graphs Area Under Graphs Gradients

## Learning Objectives
- Describe motion in one and two dimensions using displacement, velocity, acceleration and graphs of motion.
- Apply Newton's laws of motion to analyse linear dynamics, including friction and tension forces.
- Use principles of momentum conservation and impulse for collisions and explosions.
- Calculate work done by forces, changes in kinetic and potential energy, and evaluate mechanical power.
- Use interactive simulations to reinforce understanding of concepts.

## Key Terminology
- **Kinematics**: Study of the description of motion without considering the causes.
- **Momentum**: Vector quantity given by mass multiplied by velocity ($p=mv$).
- **Impulse**: Change in momentum produced by a force acting over a time interval ($\Delta p=Ft$).
- **Work**: Product of the force component in the direction of displacement and the displacement ($W=Fd\cos\theta$).
- **Efficiency**: Ratio of useful output energy or power to the total input expressed as a percentage.
- **Benchmark**: Standard or point of reference for comparison.

## Core Explanations
- Using the equations of uniformly accelerated motion $v=u+at$, $s=ut+\tfrac{1}{2}at^2$, $v^2=u^2+2as$ to solve kinematics problems.
- Drawing free-body diagrams and applying $\sum F=ma$ to determine resultant forces and subsequent accelerations.
- Conservation of linear momentum in closed systems, including elastic and inelastic collisions and the coefficient of restitution.
- Energy conversions: gravitational potential energy, kinetic energy, and energy lost to friction or air resistance.
- Definition of power $P=\tfrac{dW}{dt}$ and using $P=Fv$ for constant-speed motion.
- Apply principles in realistic contexts such as laboratory experiments.

## Worked Examples
1. *Projectile motion*: Calculate the range of a projectile launched at 20 m/s at 30° above the horizontal, ignoring air resistance.
   - Horizontal speed $v_x=20\cos30°=17.3$ m/s.
   - Time of flight $t=\tfrac{2v\sin30°}{g}=\tfrac{2\times20\times0.5}{9.8}\approx2.04$ s.
   - Range $R=v_x t\approx17.3\times2.04\approx35$ m.
2. *Impulse of a bouncing ball*: A 0.2 kg ball strikes a wall with speed 10 m/s and rebounds with the same speed. Calculate the magnitude of impulse.
   - Change in momentum $\Delta p=mv_f-mv_i=0.2(-10)-0.2(10)=-4$ kg m/s; magnitude $4\,\text{N\,s}$.
3. *Power in lifting*: A lift motor raises a 500 kg load at constant speed 2 m/s. Determine the power output.
   - Power $P=Fv=mgv=500\times9.8\times2\approx9.8\times10^3$ W.

4. *Practice problem*: Use this problem to check your understanding of the theory.
   - Solution steps should include reasoning and final answer with units.

## Exam Tips
- Resolve vectors into perpendicular components before applying Newton's laws.
- Use conservation of energy to check calculations for projectile motion or systems with springs.
- Include direction in momentum and impulse calculations; choose a consistent sign convention.
- Review past papers to identify common question patterns.

## Common Pitfalls
- Forgetting that weight acts vertically downward when analyzing inclined planes.
- Assuming momentum is conserved when external forces (like friction or tension) act significantly.
- Neglecting the difference between instantaneous velocity and average velocity in calculations.
- Overlooking units when substituting values into formulas.
