# Fields and Capacitance

## Learning Objectives
- Describe electric field lines, potential and equipotential surfaces around point charges and between parallel plates.
- Apply Coulomb's law and electric field formulas to calculate forces and field strengths.
- Analyse the motion of charged particles in electric and magnetic fields and use $F=qE$ and $F=Bqv$.
- Understand energy storage in capacitors, derive expressions for charge, energy and time constant in RC circuits.

## Key Terminology
- **Electric field strength ($E$)**: Force per unit charge experienced by a small positive test charge.
- **Magnetic flux density ($B$)**: Measure of magnetic field strength with units tesla (T).
- **Capacitance ($C$)**: Charge stored per unit potential difference ($C=Q/V$).
- **Lorentz force**: Combined electric and magnetic force on a charged particle.
- **Time constant ($\tau$)**: Product $RC$ giving the characteristic time for charge to change by $1/e$ of its initial value.

## Core Explanations
- Field patterns: radial around point charges, uniform between parallel plates, circular around a current-carrying wire and into/out of the page for solenoids.
- Coulomb's law $F=\tfrac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\tfrac{Qq}{r^2}$; electric field $E=F/q$ and potential $V=\tfrac{Q}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 r}$.
- Motion of charges in crossed electric and magnetic fields, applications such as velocity selectors and mass spectrometers.
- Deriving capacitor charge and discharge equations $Q=Q_0e^{-t/RC}$ and energy stored $E=\tfrac12 CV^2$.
- Magnetic force on a current-carrying wire $F=BIL\sin\theta$ and use of Fleming's left-hand rule.

## Worked Examples
1. *Capacitor energy*: A 10 μF capacitor charged to 12 V stores how much energy?
   - $E=\tfrac12 CV^2=0.5\times10\times10^{-6}\times12^2=7.2\times10^{-4}$ J.
2. *Magnetic force*: Find the force on a 0.5 m wire carrying 3 A perpendicular to a 0.2 T magnetic field.
   - $F=BIL=0.2\times3\times0.5=0.3$ N.
3. *Deflection in electric field*: An electron enters a uniform electric field of strength $5\times10^4$ V/m with velocity $2\times10^6$ m/s perpendicular to the field. Determine its acceleration.
   - $a=\tfrac{F}{m}=\tfrac{qE}{m}=\tfrac{1.6\times10^{-19}\times5\times10^4}{9.11\times10^{-31}}\approx8.8\times10^{15}$ m/s².

## Exam Tips
- Indicate direction of electric field lines from positive to negative and remember field lines never cross.
- Apply Fleming's left-hand rule carefully: thumb (motion), first finger (field), second finger (current).
- When dealing with capacitors, check whether they are in series or parallel to find equivalent capacitance before using $Q=CV$.

## Common Pitfalls
- Forgetting that energy stored in a capacitor is $\tfrac12 CV^2$, not $CV^2$.
- Mixing units when calculating magnetic flux density or electric field strength—use tesla and volts per metre respectively.
- Ignoring the direction of force when charges enter fields at an angle; component analysis may be required.
