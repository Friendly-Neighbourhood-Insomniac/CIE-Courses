# Circular Motion Centripetal Force Angular Speed

## Learning Objectives
- Describe uniform circular motion and define angular displacement, velocity and acceleration.
- Apply centripetal force and acceleration formulae to vehicles on bends and motion in vertical circles.
- Explain gravitational fields in terms of field strength and potential, applying Newton's law of gravitation to planetary motion.
- Use Kepler's laws and energy considerations to analyse orbits of satellites and derive expressions such as escape velocity.
- Use interactive simulations to reinforce understanding of concepts.

## Key Terminology
- **Centripetal force**: Resultant force acting towards the centre of a circular path keeping an object in circular motion.
- **Gravitational field strength**: Force per unit mass experienced by a small test mass ($g=F/m$).
- **Orbital period**: Time taken for one complete orbit around a central body.
- **Escape velocity**: Minimum velocity required for an object to move away from a celestial body without further propulsion.
- **Gravitational potential**: Work done per unit mass to move a small test mass from infinity to a point in the field.
- **Benchmark**: Standard or point of reference for comparison.

## Core Explanations

### Uniform Circular Motion
When an object moves at constant speed in a circle, its angular velocity is $\omega=\frac{\theta}{t}=\frac{2\pi}{T}$ and its linear speed is $v=\omega r$. Funfair rides in Johannesburg rely on this relationship to keep passengers safe.

### Centripetal Force and Acceleration
The inward force required for circular motion is $F_c=\frac{mv^2}{r}=m\omega^2 r$. For a car rounding a bend, friction and the normal reaction provide this force. The associated acceleration is $a_c=\frac{v^2}{r}$.

### Motion in the Vertical Plane
For objects such as a bucket swung in a circle, the tension at the top must satisfy $\frac{v^2}{r}\ge g$ to avoid slack. At the bottom, tension is greater due to both centripetal force and weight.

### Gravitational Fields and Orbits
A spherical mass $M$ produces a field strength $g=\frac{GM}{r^2}$ and potential $\phi=-\frac{GM}{r}$. A satellite orbiting Earth uses gravity as its centripetal force: $\frac{GMm}{r^2}=\frac{mv^2}{r}$ giving $v=\sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}$. South African television satellites follow geostationary orbits about 36\,000\,km above Earth.

### Energy Considerations
Gravitational potential energy at distance $r$ is $U=-\frac{GMm}{r}$. The total mechanical energy of a circular orbit is $E=-\frac{GMm}{2r}$. Escape velocity results from equating kinetic energy to the magnitude of the gravitational potential energy at the surface: $v_e=\sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}$.

### Everyday Application
Commuter trains in Gauteng use banked curves so the horizontal component of the normal reaction supplies the centripetal force, reducing wear on the wheels. Engineers choose the angle using $F_c=mv^2/r$.

## Worked Example: Satellite Speed
Find the speed of a weather satellite orbiting $2.0\times10^6\,\text{m}$ above Earth (Earth radius $6.4\times10^6\,\text{m}$, $GM=3.99\times10^{14}\,\text{m}^3\text{s}^{-2}$).

**Solution**
1. Calculate the orbital radius: $r=6.4\times10^6+2.0\times10^6=8.4\times10^6\,\text{m}$.
2. Use $v=\sqrt{GM/r}$.
3. Substitute the values: $v=\sqrt{\frac{3.99\times10^{14}}{8.4\times10^6}}$.
4. Evaluate to obtain $v\approx6.9\times10^3\,\text{m s}^{-1}$.

**Answer**
$\boxed{v\approx6.9\times10^{3}\,\text{m s}^{-1}}$

## Exam Tips
- Convert all distances to metres before using $G=6.67\times10^{-11}\,\text{N m}^2\text{kg}^{-2}$.
- Identify which physical force provides the centripetal force in each scenario.
- Quote numerical values to the precision stated in the question to avoid lost marks.
- Set out each algebraic step clearly when deriving formulae.
- Check that final answers have correct units and sensible magnitudes.

## Common Pitfalls
- Mixing up angular and linear speed: remember $v=\omega r$.
- Treating $g$ as constant far from Earth instead of using $g=GM/r^2$.
- Forgetting the factor of $2$ in the escape velocity equation.
- Dropping units in calculations leading to errors.

<summary>Solutions</summary>

**1.** Equate gravitational force to centripetal force: $\frac{GMm}{r^2}=\frac{mv^2}{r}$ giving $v=\sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}$.

**2a.** $F_c=\frac{mv^2}{r}=\frac{1200\times15^2}{50}=5.4\times10^3\,\text{N}$.

**2b.** The frictional force must equal $F_c$, so $\mu mg=F_c$. Hence $\mu=\frac{5.4\times10^3}{1200\times9.81}\approx0.46$.
