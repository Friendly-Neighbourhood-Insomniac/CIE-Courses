# Circular Motion and Gravitation

## Learning Objectives
- Describe uniform circular motion and define angular displacement, velocity and acceleration.
- Apply centripetal force and acceleration formulae to vehicles on bends and motion in vertical circles.
- Explain gravitational fields in terms of field strength and potential, applying Newton's law of gravitation to planetary motion.
- Use Kepler's laws and energy considerations to analyse orbits of satellites and derive expressions such as escape velocity.
- Use interactive simulations to reinforce understanding of concepts.

## Key Terminology
- **Centripetal force**: Resultant force acting towards the centre of a circular path keeping an object in circular motion.
- **Gravitational field strength**: Force per unit mass experienced by a small test mass ($g=F/m$).
- **Orbital period**: Time taken for one complete orbit around a central body.
- **Escape velocity**: Minimum velocity required for an object to move away from a celestial body without further propulsion.
- **Gravitational potential**: Work done per unit mass to move a small test mass from infinity to a point in the field.
- **Benchmark**: Standard or point of reference for comparison.

## Core Explanations
- Angular quantities: $\omega=\frac{\theta}{t}$ and centripetal acceleration $a_c=\omega^2 r=\frac{v^2}{r}$.
- Derivation of Newton's law of gravitation $F=\frac{GMm}{r^2}$ and how it leads to $g=\frac{GM}{r^2}$ for spherical masses.
- Explanation of orbital motion using centripetal force provided by gravity: $\frac{GMm}{r^2}=\frac{mv^2}{r}$ ⇒ $v=\sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}$.
- Kepler's third law showing that $T^2\propto r^3$ for planets orbiting the Sun.
- Escape velocity obtained from equating kinetic energy to gravitational potential energy change: $\tfrac{1}{2}mv_e^2=\frac{GMm}{r}$.
- Apply principles in realistic contexts such as laboratory experiments.

## Worked Examples
1. *Satellite orbit*: Calculate the orbital speed of a satellite 700 km above Earth's surface (Earth radius 6400 km, $g=9.8$ m/s² at surface).
   - $v=\sqrt{GM/r}$ with $r=7100\times10^3$ m ($GM=3.99\times10^{14}$) ⇒ $v\approx7.5\times10^3$ m/s.
2. *Gravitational force*: Find the gravitational force between two 1 kg masses separated by 0.5 m.
   - $F=Gm_1m_2/r^2=6.67\times10^{-11}\times1\times1/0.25=2.7\times10^{-10}$ N.
3. *Escape velocity*: Determine escape velocity from Earth's surface ignoring air resistance.
   - $v_e=\sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}$ with $R=6400\times10^3$ m ⇒ $v_e\approx1.12\times10^4$ m/s.

4. *Practice problem*: Use this problem to check your understanding of the theory.
   - Solution steps should include reasoning and final answer with units.

## Exam Tips
- Convert all distances to metres before using the universal gravitational constant.
- Remember that centripetal force is provided by another force such as tension or gravity; identify it in free-body diagrams.
- Quote values for $G$ and planetary radii to appropriate significant figures in calculations.
- Review past papers to identify common question patterns.

## Common Pitfalls
- Confusing angular speed (rad/s) with linear speed (m/s); they are related by $v=\omega r$.
- Assuming gravitational field strength is constant far from the Earth's surface—it decreases with $1/r^2$.
- Omitting the factor of 2 in escape velocity derivations, leading to incorrect results.
- Overlooking units when substituting values into formulas.
