# Practical Skills Planning Analysis Uncertainties

## Learning Objectives
- Plan investigations identifying variables and relevant safety considerations.
- Analyse data using appropriate significant figures and units.
- Calculate percentage uncertainties and combine errors in derived quantities.

## Key Terminology
- **Concept**: Key idea related to the topic.

## Core Explanations
Experiments require a clear procedure, identification of control variables and assessment of risk.  When processing data, uncertainties must be quoted to an appropriate number of significant figures.  Combining uncertainties follows the rules for addition, subtraction and multiplication of quantities.

## Worked Examples
1. *Graph analysis*: Determine the gradient and its uncertainty from an experimental \(y\)â€“\(x\) graph.
2. *Uncertainty calculation*: Combine percentage uncertainties for mass and volume to find the uncertainty in density.

## Exam Tips
- Check units carefully when substituting numbers into equations.
- Show intermediate steps to gain method marks.

## Common Pitfalls
- Misreading the question or forgetting to convert units can cause errors.
