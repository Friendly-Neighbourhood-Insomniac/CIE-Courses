# Thermal Physics and Ideal Gases

## Learning Objectives
- Describe the kinetic theory of gases and how particle motion relates to macroscopic quantities like pressure and temperature.
- Apply the ideal gas equation $pV=nRT$ and derive it from basic assumptions about molecular motion.
- Explain internal energy, first law of thermodynamics and apply $\Delta U=Q-W$ to energy transfer processes.
- Calculate specific heat capacity and specific latent heat for different substances and analyse heating and cooling curves.

## Key Terminology
- **Mole**: Amount of substance containing Avogadro's number ($6.02\times10^{23}$) of particles.
- **Internal energy**: Sum of kinetic and potential energies of molecules within a system.
- **Specific heat capacity**: Energy required to raise the temperature of unit mass by 1 K.
- **Boltzmann constant ($k_B$)**: Relates average kinetic energy of a particle to absolute temperature ($E_k=\tfrac{3}{2}k_BT$ for monatomic gases).
- **Isothermal process**: Thermodynamic change occurring at constant temperature.

## Core Explanations
- Pressure arises from molecular collisions with container walls; mean kinetic energy is proportional to absolute temperature.
- Ideal gas equation derived from kinetic theory leads to $pV=nRT$ or $pV=N k_B T$ where $N$ is number of molecules.
- First law of thermodynamics $\Delta U=Q-W$ distinguishes heat transferred to a system from work done by the system.
- Work done in a volume change $W=\int p \,dV$, with sign conventions for expansion and compression.
- Phase changes and use of latent heat $Q=mL$ along with heating curves showing constant temperature during melting or boiling.

## Worked Examples
1. *Gas volume*: Calculate the volume occupied by 0.5 mol of an ideal gas at 300 K and 100 kPa.
   - $V=\frac{nRT}{p}=\frac{0.5\times8.31\times300}{100000}=0.0125$ m³.
2. *First law*: If 500 J of heat is supplied to a gas which does 200 J of work, find the change in internal energy.
   - $\Delta U=Q-W=500-200=300$ J.
3. *Root-mean-square speed*: Determine the rms speed of oxygen molecules at 300 K (molecular mass 32 g/mol).
   - $v_{\text{rms}}=\sqrt{\tfrac{3k_BT}{m}}$ where $m=32\times10^{-3}/N_A$. Result ≈ 480 m/s.

## Exam Tips
- Temperatures must be in Kelvin for all ideal gas calculations.
- Indicate clearly whether work is done on the gas (positive) or by the gas (negative) when applying the first law.
- State assumptions of the ideal gas model—negligible particle volume, random motion and elastic collisions—when appropriate.

## Common Pitfalls
- Using Celsius instead of Kelvin when substituting into $pV=nRT$.
- Assuming ideal behaviour at very high pressures or very low temperatures where real gases deviate from the ideal model.
- Confusing specific heat capacity (J/kg K) with specific latent heat (J/kg).
