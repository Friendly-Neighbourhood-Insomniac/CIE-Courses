# Nuclear and Quantum Physics

## Learning Objectives
- Explain key phenomena of quantum physics including the photoelectric effect and wave–particle duality.
- Describe nuclear structure, radioactive decay processes and nuclear reactions such as fission and fusion.
- Interpret energy level diagrams, emission and absorption spectra, and use $E=hf$ for photon energies.
- Understand applications of nuclear energy and particle physics including medical imaging and particle accelerators.

## Key Terminology
- **Photon**: Quantum packet of electromagnetic radiation energy $E=hf$.
- **Work function**: Minimum energy needed to liberate an electron from a metal surface.
- **Fission**: Splitting of a heavy nucleus into lighter nuclei, releasing energy.
- **Binding energy**: Energy required to split a nucleus into its constituent nucleons.
- **Half-life**: Time taken for half the atoms in a radioactive sample to decay.

## Core Explanations
- Photoelectric effect: emission of electrons when light above threshold frequency is incident on a metal, demonstrating particle nature of light.
- Einstein's photoelectric equation $hf=\phi +K_{\text{max}}$; stopping potential measurement of maximum kinetic energy.
- Radioactive decay laws, activity $A=\lambda N$ and exponential decay $N=N_0 e^{-\lambda t}$.
- Nuclear binding energy and mass defect illustrated through $E=\Delta mc^2$, nuclear fission and fusion energy release.
- Fundamental particles: leptons, quarks, baryons, mesons; conservation laws in particle interactions.

## Worked Examples
1. *Photoelectric effect*: Calculate the maximum kinetic energy of electrons emitted from sodium ($\phi=2.3$ eV) when illuminated with 300 nm light.
   - $E=hc/\lambda=6.63\times10^{-34}\times3\times10^8/(300\times10^{-9})=6.63\times10^{-19}$ J (4.14 eV); $K_{\text{max}}=4.14-2.3=1.84$ eV.
2. *Nuclear fission energy*: Determine the energy released when 1 u of mass is converted to energy.
   - $E=mc^2=1\,\text{u}\times931\,\text{MeV/u}=931$ MeV ≈ $1.5\times10^{-10}$ J.
3. *Half-life calculation*: A radioactive isotope has decay constant $\lambda=0.005$ s⁻¹. What is its half-life?
   - $t_{1/2}=\ln2/\lambda=0.693/0.005\approx139$ s.

## Exam Tips
- Convert electronvolts to joules when substituting into formulas; $1\,\text{eV}=1.6\times10^{-19}$ J.
- Check conservation of nucleon number, proton number and charge in nuclear equations.
- When using binding energy per nucleon, compare values to determine stability of nuclei.

## Common Pitfalls
- Applying classical wave theory where quantum explanation is required, e.g. the photoelectric effect threshold frequency.
- Neglecting mass–energy equivalence when analysing nuclear reactions.
- Forgetting that half-life is independent of the initial amount of substance.
