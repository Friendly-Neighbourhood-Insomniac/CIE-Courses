# Oscillations

## Learning Objectives
- Define simple harmonic motion (SHM) and identify systems that perform SHM.
- Derive and use the equations of motion for SHM to calculate displacement, velocity and acceleration at any time.
- Discuss energy changes in an oscillating system and describe damping and resonance phenomena.
- Use graphical representations to analyse phase relationships and energy exchange in oscillatory systems.
- Use interactive simulations to reinforce understanding of concepts.

## Key Terminology
- **Amplitude**: Maximum displacement from the equilibrium position.
- **Period ($T$)**: Time taken for one complete oscillation.
- **Resonance**: Large amplitude response when a system is driven at its natural frequency.
- **Angular frequency ($\omega$)**: Rate of change of phase, related by $\omega=2\pi/T$.
- **Damping**: Process by which energy is lost from an oscillating system, reducing amplitude over time.
- **Benchmark**: Standard or point of reference for comparison.

## Core Explanations
- Conditions for SHM: acceleration is proportional to displacement and directed towards the equilibrium position ($a=-\omega^2 x$).
- Solutions to the differential equation: $x=A\cos(\omega t+\phi)$ and $v=-A\omega\sin(\omega t+\phi)$.
- Interchange of kinetic and potential energy during oscillation, with total energy constant for undamped systems.
- Forced oscillations and resonance, amplitude–frequency graphs showing how damping affects peak amplitude.
- Damped SHM and the exponential decay of amplitude; critical damping versus over- and under-damping.
- Apply principles in realistic contexts such as laboratory experiments.

## Worked Examples
1. *Mass–spring system*: For a mass of 0.5 kg on a spring of constant 8 N/m, find the period of oscillation.
   - $T=2\pi\sqrt{m/k}=2\pi\sqrt{0.5/8}=1.57$ s.
2. *Energy in SHM*: For amplitude 0.1 m and spring constant 8 N/m, determine the maximum kinetic energy.
   - $E=\tfrac12 kA^2=0.5\times8\times(0.1)^2=0.04$ J.
3. *Resonance*: Explain how resonance could cause structural damage in a bridge if the driving frequency matches the natural frequency.
   - External periodic forces with frequency equal to the natural frequency cause large amplitude oscillations, potentially exceeding the material's limit.

4. *Practice problem*: Use this problem to check your understanding of the theory.
   - Solution steps should include reasoning and final answer with units.

## Exam Tips
- Use radians when working with $\omega t$ in the SHM equations.
- Sketch displacement–time, velocity–time and acceleration–time graphs to visualise phase differences.
- For damping questions, mention how energy is dissipated (e.g., friction or air resistance) and its effect on amplitude.
- Review past papers to identify common question patterns.

## Common Pitfalls
- Using degrees instead of radians in SHM formulas leading to incorrect results.
- Forgetting the negative sign in $a=-\omega^2x$ which indicates the acceleration is towards equilibrium.
- Assuming total energy remains constant in the presence of damping.
- Overlooking units when substituting values into formulas.
