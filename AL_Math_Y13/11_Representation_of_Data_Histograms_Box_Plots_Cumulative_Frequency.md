# Representation of Data Histograms Box Plots Cumulative Frequency

## Learning Objectives
- Construct histograms using frequency density and unequal class widths.
- Interpret box-and-whisker plots to compare distributions.
- Use cumulative frequency curves to estimate median and quartiles.

## Key Terminology
- **Frequency**: Number of oscillations per second of a wave.

## Core Explanations
Histograms display grouped data where the area of each bar represents frequency. Box plots summarise data using the five-number summary. Cumulative frequency diagrams allow estimation of percentiles and spread, useful for interpreting exam statistics.

## Worked Examples
1. *Histogram analysis*: Draw a histogram for a grouped frequency table and find the modal class.
2. *Cumulative frequency*: From cumulative data, estimate the median and interquartile range.

## Exam Tips
- Check units carefully when substituting numbers into equations.
- Show intermediate steps to gain method marks.

## Common Pitfalls
- Misreading the question or forgetting to convert units can cause errors.
