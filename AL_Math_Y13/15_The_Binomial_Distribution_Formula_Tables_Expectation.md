# The Binomial Distribution Formula Tables Expectation

## Learning Objectives
- Recognise situations modelled by the binomial distribution.
- Use \(P(X=r)=\binom{n}{r}p^r(1-p)^{n-r}\) to calculate probabilities.
- Determine mean and variance \(np\) and \(np(1-p)\).

## Key Terminology
- **Concept**: Key idea related to the topic.

## Core Explanations
The binomial model applies to a fixed number of independent trials with constant probability of success. Tables are provided for cumulative probabilities. Expectation and variance describe the long-term behaviour of repeated experiments.

## Worked Examples
1. *Probability from formula*: Find \(P(X=3)\) when \(n=5\) and \(p=0.6\).
2. *Using tables*: With \(n=20\) and \(p=0.4\), use binomial tables to evaluate \(P(X\ge15)\).
