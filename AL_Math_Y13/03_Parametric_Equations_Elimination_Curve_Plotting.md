# Parametric Equations Elimination Curve Plotting

## Learning Objectives
- Convert parametric equations to Cartesian form by eliminating the parameter.
- Plot curves defined parametrically and determine tangents using \(\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{dy/dt}{dx/dt}\).
- Use differentiation of parametric equations to solve coordinate geometry problems.

## Key Terminology
- **Concept**: Key idea related to the topic.

## Core Explanations
Elimination of parameters often uses substitution or trigonometric identities to rewrite \(x(t)\) and \(y(t)\) as a single Cartesian equation.  Gradients of parametric curves are found from
\[
\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{\frac{dy}{dt}}{\frac{dx}{dt}}.
\]
Sketching involves computing key points and describing behaviour for given intervals of \(t\).

## Worked Examples
1. *Eliminate the parameter*: For \(x=3t\) and \(y=t^2+1\) express the curve in Cartesian form and find the gradient when \(t=2\).
2. *Curve sketching*: Plot \(x=\cos t\), \(y=1+\sin t\) for \(0\le t\le 2\pi\) and identify turning points.
