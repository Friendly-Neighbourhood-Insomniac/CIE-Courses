# Complex Numbers

## Learning Objectives
- Perform arithmetic with complex numbers in Cartesian and polar forms.
- Apply De Moivre's theorem to find powers and roots of complex numbers.
- Represent complex numbers on an Argand diagram and interpret loci.
- Solve equations involving complex numbers and apply them in polynomial factorisation.
- Use interactive simulations to reinforce understanding of concepts.

## Key Terminology
- **Complex number**: Number of the form $a+bi$ where $i^2=-1$.
- **Modulus**: Distance from the origin in the Argand plane, $|z|=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$.
- **Argument**: Angle made with the positive real axis measured anticlockwise, $\arg z$.
- **Polar form**: Representation $z=r(\cos\theta+i\sin\theta)$ or $re^{i\theta}$.
- **Conjugate**: For $z=a+bi$, the conjugate is $\bar z=a-bi$.
- **Benchmark**: Standard or point of reference for comparison.

## Core Explanations
- Conversion between Cartesian and polar forms: $a+bi=r(\cos\theta+i\sin\theta)$ with $r=|z|$ and $\theta=\arctan(b/a)$.
- Multiplication and division become easier in polar form: $r_1e^{i\theta_1}\times r_2e^{i\theta_2}=r_1r_2e^{i(\theta_1+\theta_2)}$.
- De Moivre's theorem $(\cos\theta+i\sin\theta)^n=\cos(n\theta)+i\sin(n\theta)$ allows computation of powers and extraction of nth roots.
- Loci of complex numbers representing geometric conditions, e.g., $|z-a|=r$ is a circle of radius $r$.
- Factorising real polynomials with complex roots occurring in conjugate pairs.
- Apply principles in realistic contexts such as laboratory experiments.

## Worked Examples
1. *Multiplication*: $(3+4i)(2-i)=6+8i-3i-4i^2=10+5i$.
2. *Finding roots*: Solve $z^3=1$.
   - Express in polar form: $1=e^{i2\pi k}$. Roots are $z=e^{i2\pi k/3}$ for $k=0,1,2$, giving $1$, $-\tfrac12+\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i$, $-\tfrac12-\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i$.
3. *Locus*: Describe the locus of points satisfying $|z-1|=|z+1|$.
   - This is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining -1 and 1 on the real axis, i.e., the imaginary axis.

4. *Practice problem*: Use this problem to check your understanding of the theory.
   - Solution steps should include reasoning and final answer with units.

## Exam Tips
- Express final answers in the form requested—Cartesian or polar—and include the argument in radians if specified.
- When finding nth roots, add multiples of $2\pi$ to the angle and divide by $n$ to capture all distinct solutions.
- Use conjugate pairs to write quadratic factors of real polynomials.
- Review past papers to identify common question patterns.

## Common Pitfalls
- Misplacing negative signs when converting from exponential to Cartesian form, leading to incorrect real or imaginary parts.
- Forgetting to include $2\pi k$ when solving for all arguments in De Moivre applications.
- Mixing degrees and radians when interpreting arguments.
- Overlooking units when substituting values into formulas.
