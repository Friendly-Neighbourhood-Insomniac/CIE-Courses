# Numerical Methods Iteration NewtonRaphson

## Learning Objectives
- Use iterative formulae to approximate solutions of equations.
- Apply the Newton–Raphson method \(x_{n+1}=x_n-\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}\) to find roots.
- Discuss convergence and choose suitable starting values for numerical methods.

## Key Terminology
- **Concept**: Key idea related to the topic.

## Core Explanations
Iteration methods rearrange an equation into the form \(x=g(x)\).  Successive substitution produces a sequence converging to the root when \(|g'(x)|<1\).  The Newton–Raphson method uses tangents to refine an initial estimate and generally converges rapidly provided \(f'(x)\neq0\) near the root.

## Worked Examples
1. *Iteration formula*: Use \(x_{n+1}=\sqrt{5+x_n}\) with \(x_0=2\) to approximate a root of \(x^2-x-5=0\) correct to three decimal places.
2. *Newton–Raphson*: Starting at \(x_0=1\), apply Newton–Raphson to \(f(x)=x^3-2x-5\) and give the root to four significant figures.
