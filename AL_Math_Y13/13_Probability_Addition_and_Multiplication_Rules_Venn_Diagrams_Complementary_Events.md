# Probability Addition and Multiplication Rules Venn Diagrams Complementary Events

## Learning Objectives
- Apply the addition rule \(P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)\).
- Use multiplication rules for independent and conditional events.
- Represent events with Venn diagrams and identify complements.

## Key Terminology
- **Probability**: Measure of likelihood of an event.

## Core Explanations
Venn diagrams help visualise the relationships between events.  The addition rule removes double counting of intersections.  For independent events \(P(A\cap B)=P(A)P(B)\).  Conditional probability uses \(P(A|B)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}\).

## Worked Examples
1. *Venn diagram*: Given two overlapping events with known probabilities, find \(P(A\cup B)\).
2. *Conditional probability*: Use the multiplication rule to determine \(P(A|B)\) in a word problem.
