# Trigonometric Identities and Equations (Advanced)

## Learning Objectives
- Apply compound-angle, double-angle and half-angle formulae in solving trigonometric problems.
- Solve trigonometric equations over specified domains using algebraic manipulation and graphs.
- Simplify expressions and prove identities involving sine, cosine and tangent functions.
- Use the laws of sines and cosines as well as area formulas in triangles, including applications in polar coordinates.
- Use interactive simulations to reinforce understanding of concepts.

## Key Terminology
- **Compound angle**: Expression involving the sum or difference of two angles such as $\sin(A\pm B)$.
- **Double-angle formula**: Identities for $\sin2x$, $\cos2x$ and $\tan2x$ derived from compound angle formulae.
- **Period**: Interval over which a trigonometric function repeats its values.
- **Amplitude**: Maximum displacement from the midline in a trigonometric graph.
- **Principal value**: The primary solution of an inverse trigonometric function, usually within a restricted range.
- **Benchmark**: Standard or point of reference for comparison.

## Core Explanations
- Derivation of the addition formulas $\sin(A\pm B)=\sin A\cos B\pm\cos A\sin B$ and $\cos(A\pm B)=\cos A\cos B\mp\sin A\sin B$.
- Using double-angle identities to express functions such as $\sin^2x$ or $\cos^2x$ in terms of $\cos2x$.
- Techniques to solve equations like $\sin 2x=\sin x$ or $\cos2x+\cos x=0$ within a specified range by factorising or using identities.
- Application of trigonometric rules to polar coordinates and converting between polar and Cartesian forms.
- Graphical interpretation of trigonometric functions to verify solutions and identify general patterns.
- Apply principles in realistic contexts such as laboratory experiments.

## Worked Examples
1. *Double angle simplification*: Simplify $\sin2x\cos x$.
   - $\sin2x\cos x=(2\sin x\cos x)\cos x=2\sin x\cos^2x$.
2. *Equation solving*: Solve $\cos2x=0.5$ for $0°\le x\le180°$.
   - $2x=60°$ or $300°$ ⇒ $x=30°$ or $150°$.
3. *Identity proof*: Prove that $\tan(x+\pi)=\tan x$.
   - Use $\tan(x+\pi)=\tfrac{\sin(x+\pi)}{\cos(x+\pi)}=\tfrac{-\sin x}{-\cos x}=\tan x$.

4. *Practice problem*: Use this problem to check your understanding of the theory.
   - Solution steps should include reasoning and final answer with units.

## Exam Tips
- When solving equations, list all solutions in the given domain using periodicity (e.g. $x+360°k$) if necessary.
- Use identities to convert products to sums or vice versa for easier integration or differentiation.
- Express angles in radians when using calculus-based approaches, such as differentiation of trigonometric functions.
- Review past papers to identify common question patterns.

## Common Pitfalls
- Forgetting that trigonometric functions are periodic and not considering multiple cycles within the domain.
- Mixing radian and degree measures in the same calculation, leading to errors.
- Losing solutions by dividing by a trigonometric expression without checking when it equals zero.
- Overlooking units when substituting values into formulas.
