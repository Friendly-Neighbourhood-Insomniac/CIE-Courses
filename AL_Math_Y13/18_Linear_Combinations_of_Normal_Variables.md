# Linear Combinations Of Normal Variables

## Learning Objectives
- Form linear combinations \(aX+bY\) of independent normal variables.
- Derive the resulting mean and variance of the combination.
- Apply the normal model to sums and differences of measurements.

## Key Terminology
- **Concept**: Key idea related to the topic.

## Core Explanations
If \(X\sim N(\mu_X,\sigma_X^2)\) and \(Y\sim N(\mu_Y,\sigma_Y^2)\) are independent, then \(aX+bY\) is normally distributed with mean \(a\mu_X+b\mu_Y\) and variance \(a^2\sigma_X^2+b^2\sigma_Y^2\).  This allows modelling of totals and differences of measurements subject to random error.

## Worked Examples
1. *Sum of normals*: Find the distribution of \(X+Y\) when \(X\sim N(10,4)\) and \(Y\sim N(5,1)\).
2. *Difference of readings*: Determine \(P(X-Y>2)\) for two independent measurements with known means and variances.
