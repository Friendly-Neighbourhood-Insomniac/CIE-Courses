# Measures Of Central Tendency And Spread Mean Median Variance Standard Deviation

## Learning Objectives
- Calculate mean, median and mode for discrete and grouped data.
- Determine variance and standard deviation using the appropriate formulae.
- Compare sets of data using measures of central tendency and spread.

## Key Terminology
- **Concept**: Key idea related to the topic.

## Core Explanations
The mean of \(n\) values is \(\bar{x}=\frac{\sum x}{n}\).  Variance is calculated as \(\sigma^2=\frac{\sum(x-\bar{x})^2}{n}\) and standard deviation is its square root.  In grouped data, mid-interval values are used for the calculations.  These measures summarise the location and dispersion of a distribution.

## Worked Examples
1. *Calculating mean and SD*: Given a frequency table, compute the mean and standard deviation of the data.
2. *Comparing data sets*: Decide which of two distributions is more consistent using variance.
