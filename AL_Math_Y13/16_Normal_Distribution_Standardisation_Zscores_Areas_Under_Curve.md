# Normal Distribution Standardisation Zscores Areas Under Curve

## Learning Objectives
- Recognise features of the normal distribution with mean \(\mu\) and variance \(\sigma^2\).
- Convert raw scores to standardised values using \(Z=\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}\).
- Use tables to find probabilities and areas under the normal curve.

## Key Terminology
- **Concept**: Key idea related to the topic.

## Core Explanations
Many real-world variables follow a bell-shaped normal distribution.  Standardising allows any normal variable to be compared with the standard normal table.  Probabilities correspond to areas under the curve and can be found using symmetry and complements.

## Worked Examples
1. *Finding a probability*: Given \(X\sim N(50,9)\), find \(P(X>54)\) using a Z-score.
2. *Inverse normal*: Determine the mark corresponding to the top 10\% when \(X\sim N(65,16)\).
