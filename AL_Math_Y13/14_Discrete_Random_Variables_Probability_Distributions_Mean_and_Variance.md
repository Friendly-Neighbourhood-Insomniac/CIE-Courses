# Discrete Random Variables Probability Distributions Mean and Variance

## Learning Objectives
- Define discrete random variables and their probability functions.
- Calculate expectation and variance using \(E(X)=\sum xP(X=x)\).
- Interpret distribution tables and solve related probability problems.

## Key Terminology
- **Probability**: Measure of likelihood of an event.

## Core Explanations
A discrete random variable takes specific values each with a probability between 0 and 1.  The total probability over all outcomes equals 1.  Mean and variance describe the long-run average and spread of values, helping to model real-world random processes.

## Worked Examples
1. *Probability table*: For \(X\) with \(P(X=0)=0.2\), \(P(X=1)=0.5\), \(P(X=2)=0.3\), find \(E(X)\) and \(Var(X)\).
2. *Distribution problem*: Using the given distribution, calculate \(P(X\ge1)\) and interpret its meaning.
