# Vectors in 3D Dot and Cross Products Applications

## Learning Objectives
- Use vector notation for lines and planes in three dimensions.
- Apply dot and cross products to determine angles, areas and perpendicular distances.
- Solve geometric problems involving scalar and vector products.

## Key Terminology
- **Concept**: Key idea related to the topic.

## Core Explanations
The dot product \(\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b}=|\mathbf{a}||\mathbf{b}|\cos\theta\) gives angles between vectors and projections.  The cross product \(\mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{b}\) produces a vector perpendicular to both with magnitude equal to the area of the parallelogram formed.  Lines and planes can be represented using vector equations.

## Worked Examples
1. *Angle between vectors*: Find the acute angle between \((2,1,-1)\) and \((3,0,4)\) using the dot product.
2. *Area from cross product*: Determine the area of the triangle formed by \((1,0,2)\), \((2,-1,3)\) and \((4,2,5)\).
