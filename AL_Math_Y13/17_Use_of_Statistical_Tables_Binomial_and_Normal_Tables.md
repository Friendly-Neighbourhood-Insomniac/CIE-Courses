# Use of Statistical Tables Binomial and Normal Tables

## Learning Objectives
- Read binomial and normal probability tables accurately.
- Interpolate between tabulated values when necessary.
- Apply table values to answer exam-style probability questions.

## Key Terminology
- **Concept**: Key idea related to the topic.

## Core Explanations
Statistical tables provide cumulative binomial probabilities and areas under the standard normal curve.  Entries correspond to specific parameters such as \(n\), \(p\) or \(z\).  Understanding how to locate the correct value and use symmetry is crucial for quick calculations.

## Worked Examples
1. *Using binomial tables*: Evaluate \(P(X\ge7)\) for \(X\sim B(10,0.4)\) from the cumulative table.
2. *Normal table lookup*: Find \(z\) such that \(P(Z<z)=0.975\) using the standard normal table.
