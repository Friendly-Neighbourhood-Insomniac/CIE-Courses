# Series Arithmetic And Geometric Progressions

## Learning Objectives
- Apply the formula \(S_n=\tfrac{n}{2}(2a+(n-1)d)\) for arithmetic series.
- Use \(S_n=a\tfrac{1-r^n}{1-r}\) for geometric progressions and \(S_\infty=\tfrac{a}{1-r}\) when \(|r|<1\).
- Determine common difference or ratio from given terms.

## Key Terminology
- **Concept**: Key idea related to the topic.

## Core Explanations
Arithmetic progressions have a constant difference between terms, while geometric progressions multiply by a constant ratio.  Sum formulae are derived using pairing or manipulation of the series.  Convergence of a geometric series occurs when \(|r|<1\).

## Worked Examples
1. *Arithmetic sum*: Find the tenth term and sum of the first ten terms for \(a=3\), \(d=4\).
2. *Geometric series*: Determine the sum to infinity of \(2+1+\tfrac{1}{2}+\tfrac{1}{4}+\dots\).
