# Algebra

## Learning Objectives
- Simplify algebraic expressions using factorisation, expansion and the laws of indices.
- Solve quadratic, linear and simultaneous equations both algebraically and graphically.
- Manipulate inequalities and modulus expressions in solving range problems.
- Translate word problems into algebraic equations and interpret discriminant conditions.

## Key Terminology
- **Discriminant**: Expression $b^2-4ac$ in the quadratic formula determining nature of roots.
- **Inequality**: Mathematical statement indicating one quantity is greater or less than another.
- **Modulus**: Absolute value of a quantity, written $|x|$.
- **Completing the square**: Technique to rewrite $ax^2+bx+c$ as $a(x-h)^2+k$.
- **Simultaneous equations**: Two or more equations solved for the same variables.

## Core Explanations
- Factorising quadratics using common factors, difference of squares, and the product-sum method.
- Solving quadratic equations via completing the square and quadratic formula, including complex solutions.
- Substitution and elimination methods for solving simultaneous linear and quadratic equations.
- Inequalities on a number line, representing solution sets with interval notation and graphing modulus inequalities.
- Application of the discriminant to determine whether quadratic graphs intersect the x-axis at two points, one point, or not at all.

## Worked Examples
1. *Nature of roots*: For $x^2-6x+10=0$, determine whether real roots exist.
   - Discriminant $\Delta=(-6)^2-4\times1\times10=36-40=-4<0$ so no real roots; the solutions are complex.
2. *Simultaneous equations*: Solve the system $y=x^2-3x+2$ and $y=2x-1$.
   - Substitute to get $x^2-3x+2=2x-1 \Rightarrow x^2-5x+3=0$. Roots $x=\tfrac{5\pm\sqrt{25-12}}{2}=\tfrac{5\pm\sqrt{13}}{2}$, then find $y$ values from $2x-1$.
3. *Modulus inequality*: Solve $|3x-2|\ge5$.
   - Case 1: $3x-2\ge5 \Rightarrow x\ge\tfrac{7}{3}$. Case 2: $3x-2\le-5 \Rightarrow x\le-1$. Solution is $x\le-1$ or $x\ge7/3$.

## Exam Tips
- Look for a common factor before applying other factorisation methods.
- Clearly indicate inequality direction when multiplying or dividing by a negative quantity.
- When solving simultaneously, check points of intersection graphically to avoid algebraic mistakes.

## Common Pitfalls
- Forgetting to square root both positive and negative values when taking the square root of $x^2$.
- Dropping solutions when solving modulus equations by squaring both sides without checking validity.
- Confusing the axis of symmetry $x=-b/2a$ with the location of the vertex when $a\ne1$.
