# Trigonometry Basic Identities Equations Graphs

## Learning Objectives
- Convert between degrees and radians and apply trigonometric identities to simplify expressions.
- Solve trigonometric equations in specified intervals using identities and graphs.
- Represent vectors in component form, find magnitudes, directions and perform addition, subtraction and scalar multiplication.
- Apply the sine rule, cosine rule and vector methods to solve problems in navigation and mechanics.
- Use interactive simulations to reinforce understanding of concepts.

## Key Terminology
- **Radian**: Angle measurement based on the radius of a circle; $2\pi$ radians correspond to 360°.
- **Vector**: Quantity that has both magnitude and direction, often written in column or i-j notation.
- **Unit vector**: Vector of length 1 pointing in a specified direction.
- **Scalar product**: Dot product of vectors $\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b}=|\mathbf{a}|\,|\mathbf{b}|\cos\theta$.
- **Component**: Projection of a vector along an axis, such as $(a_x,a_y)$.
- **Benchmark**: Standard or point of reference for comparison.

## Core Explanations
- Deriving the double-angle and compound-angle identities for sine and cosine and using them to simplify expressions.
- Solving equations like $\sin2x=a$ or $\cos(x\pm \alpha)=b$ by factoring and using identities.
- Vector addition using components, determining resultant magnitude and direction with $|\mathbf{r}|=\sqrt{a_x^2+a_y^2}$.
- Application of vector scalar product to find the angle between two vectors or test for perpendicularity.
- Sine rule $\tfrac{a}{\sin A}=\tfrac{b}{\sin B}=\tfrac{c}{\sin C}$ and cosine rule $c^2=a^2+b^2-2ab\cos C$ for non-right-angled triangles.
- Apply principles in realistic contexts such as laboratory experiments.

## Worked Examples
1. *Vector addition*: Find the magnitude and direction of $\mathbf{a}=(3,4)$ and $\mathbf{b}=(-1,2)$ added together.
   - Resultant $\mathbf{r}=\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}=(2,6)$; magnitude $\sqrt{2^2+6^2}=\sqrt{40}=6.32$; direction $\tan^{-1}(6/2)=71.6°$.
2. *Trigonometric equation*: Solve $\sin2x=\sqrt{3}/2$ for $0°\le x\le180°$.
   - $2x=60°$ or $120°$ ⇒ $x=30°$ or $60°$.
3. *Angle between vectors*: Given $\mathbf{p}=(4,1)$ and $\mathbf{q}=(2,-3)$, find the angle between them.
   - $\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{q}=8-3=5$, $|\mathbf{p}|=\sqrt{17}$, $|\mathbf{q}|=\sqrt{13}$, so $\cos\theta=5/(\sqrt{17}\sqrt{13})$ ⇒ $\theta\approx58°$.

4. *Practice problem*: Use this problem to check your understanding of the theory.
   - Solution steps should include reasoning and final answer with units.

## Exam Tips
- Always convert angles to radians when differentiating or integrating trigonometric functions in calculus problems.
- When solving trigonometric equations, draw a unit circle or graph to capture all solutions in the required range.
- Present vector answers with both magnitude and direction if asked for a resultant.
- Review past papers to identify common question patterns.

## Common Pitfalls
- Mixing degree and radian measures within the same problem leading to incorrect answers.
- Forgetting to include the second quadrant solution when solving $\sin x=a$ for positive $a$.
- Writing a vector magnitude with a negative sign or forgetting to use square root for magnitude.
- Overlooking units when substituting values into formulas.
