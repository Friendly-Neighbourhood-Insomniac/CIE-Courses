# Functions Domain Range Composite Inverse

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the definition of a function, domain, codomain and range.
- Perform algebraic operations with functions including composition and inversion.
- Interpret and sketch graphs of polynomial, reciprocal, exponential and logarithmic functions including basic transformations.
- Solve equations involving functions and apply modulus functions in piecewise form.
- Use interactive simulations to reinforce understanding of concepts.

## Key Terminology
- **Domain**: Set of input values for which a function is defined.
- **Range**: Actual set of outputs that a function produces for its domain.
- **Composite function**: Function formed by applying one function to the results of another, written $(g\circ f)(x)=g(f(x))$.
- **Inverse function**: Function that reverses the mapping of the original function so $f(f^{-1}(x))=x$.
- **Transformation**: Modification of a graph via translations, stretches, reflections or scalings.
- **Benchmark**: Standard or point of reference for comparison.

## Core Explanations
- Using function notation $f:x\mapsto 2x+3$ and understanding one-to-one vs many-to-one mappings.
- Determining domains for which an inverse exists and finding $f^{-1}(x)$ algebraically by interchanging variables and solving for $y$.
- Performing composition of two functions and understanding that $(g\circ f)(x) \ne (f\circ g)(x)$ in general.
- Applying transformations: $y=f(x+a)$ (horizontal shift), $y=f(x)+a$ (vertical shift), $y=af(x)$ (vertical stretch) and $y=f(ax)$ (horizontal compression).
- Properties of exponential and logarithmic functions: base restrictions, intercepts, asymptotes, and solving $\log$ equations.
- Apply principles in realistic contexts such as laboratory experiments.

## Worked Examples
1. *Composite function*: If $f(x)=2x+1$ and $g(x)=x^2$, find $(g\circ f)(x)$ and $(f\circ g)(x)$.
   - $(g\circ f)(x)=g(f(x))=(2x+1)^2$. $(f\circ g)(x)=f(x^2)=2x^2+1$.
2. *Inverse function*: For $f(x)=3x-4$, find $f^{-1}(x)$ and state its domain.
   - Swap $x$ and $y$: $x=3y-4$ gives $y=(x+4)/3$. The inverse is defined for all real $x$.
3. *Logarithmic equation*: Solve $3^{2x-1}=7$ for $x$.
   - Take logs: $(2x-1)\log 3=\log7$ â‡’ $x=\frac{1+\log7/\log3}{2}$.

4. *Practice problem*: Use this problem to check your understanding of the theory.
   - Solution steps should include reasoning and final answer with units.

## Exam Tips
- State domain restrictions when finding inverses, especially for quadratic and square root functions.
- Apply transformations in the correct order: stretches/reflections first, then translations.
- When composing functions, start from the inside and work outward.
- Review past papers to identify common question patterns.

## Common Pitfalls
- Forgetting to interchange $x$ and $y$ when finding an inverse function.
- Mixing up inside and outside transformations when describing $y=f(ax+b)$ vs $y=af(x)+b$.
- Omitting restrictions that keep square root or log functions defined for real numbers.
- Overlooking units when substituting values into formulas.
