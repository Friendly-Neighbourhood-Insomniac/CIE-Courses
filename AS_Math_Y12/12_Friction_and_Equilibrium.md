# Friction and Equilibrium

## Learning Objectives
- Use the model of limiting friction \(F=\mu R\).
- Solve equilibrium problems for bodies on rough horizontal and inclined surfaces.
- Distinguish between static and kinetic coefficients of friction.

## Key Terminology
- **Concept**: Key idea related to the topic.

## Core Explanations
Friction acts parallel to surfaces and opposes motion.  At the point of impending motion the frictional force reaches \(\mu R\), where \(\mu\) is the coefficient of friction and \(R\) the normal reaction.  Equilibrium occurs when the vector sum of forces is zero.

## Worked Examples
1. *Rough plane*: Determine the minimum force needed to start moving a box up a rough slope given \(\mu\) and the angle of incline.
2. *Horizontal surface*: Find the frictional force when a body moves with constant speed across a rough table.
