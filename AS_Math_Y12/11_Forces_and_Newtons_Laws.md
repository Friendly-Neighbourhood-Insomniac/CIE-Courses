# Forces and Newtons Laws

## Learning Objectives
- State Newton's three laws of motion.
- Resolve forces and apply \(F=ma\) to connected particles and motion on inclines.
- Solve problems involving weight, tension and normal reactions.

## Key Terminology
- **Concept**: Key idea related to the topic.

## Core Explanations
Newton's laws describe how forces affect motion.  Resultant force equals mass times acceleration.  Free-body diagrams help resolve forces horizontally and vertically, particularly on slopes or in pulley systems.

## Worked Examples
1. *Inclined plane*: Find the acceleration of a block sliding down a rough slope and the frictional force acting.
2. *Connected particles*: Determine the tension in a string linking two masses being pulled by a single force.

## Exam Tips
- Check units carefully when substituting numbers into equations.
- Show intermediate steps to gain method marks.

## Common Pitfalls
- Misreading the question or forgetting to convert units can cause errors.
