# Kinematics Equations of Motion Graphs

## Learning Objectives
- Apply the constant-acceleration equations \(v=u+at\) and \(s=ut+\tfrac{1}{2}at^2\).
- Interpret displacement–time and velocity–time graphs.
- Solve uniform acceleration problems in one dimension.

## Key Terminology
- **Concept**: Key idea related to the topic.

## Core Explanations
Kinematics describes motion using equations linking displacement \(s\), initial velocity \(u\), final velocity \(v\), acceleration \(a\) and time \(t\).  Graphs provide a visual method: the gradient of a displacement–time graph gives velocity, while the area under a velocity–time graph gives displacement.

## Worked Examples
1. *Equation application*: A car accelerates from rest at \(2\,\text{m s}^{-2}\) for 5 s. Calculate its final speed and distance travelled.
2. *Graph reading*: From a velocity–time graph, determine acceleration and total displacement during a journey.
