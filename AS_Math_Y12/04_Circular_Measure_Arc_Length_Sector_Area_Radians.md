# Circular Measure Arc Length Sector Area Radians

## Learning Objectives
- Convert angles between degrees and radians.
- Use \(s=r\theta\) and \(A=\tfrac{1}{2}r^2\theta\) for arc length and sector area.
- Solve trigonometric equations expressed in radians.

## Key Terminology
- **Concept**: Key idea related to the topic.

## Core Explanations
Radians measure angle as the ratio of arc length to radius.  Common conversions include \(180^\circ=\pi\) radians.  The arc length of a circle is \(s=r\theta\) when \(\theta\) is in radians, and the area of a sector is \(A=\tfrac{1}{2}r^2\theta\).

## Worked Examples
1. *Arc length*: Find the length of an arc of radius 5 cm subtending \(2.1\) radians.
2. *Sector area*: Calculate the area of a sector with \(r=8\) cm and angle \(75^\circ\).
