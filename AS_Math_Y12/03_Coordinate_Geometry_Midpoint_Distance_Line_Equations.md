# Coordinate Geometry

## Learning Objectives
- Find equations of lines and circles in the Cartesian plane using gradient and coordinate conditions.
- Determine gradients, intercepts, midpoints and distances between points and apply these to geometry problems.
- Understand properties of perpendicular and parallel lines, and solve problems involving tangents and normals to curves.
- Use the equation of a circle to find intersections with lines and other circles, and interpret locus problems.
- Use interactive simulations to reinforce understanding of concepts.

## Key Terminology
- **Gradient**: Measure of the slope of a line; for line through $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$, $m=\tfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$.
- **Intercept**: Point where a line crosses the x-axis or y-axis.
- **Circle equation**: $(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2=r^2$ represents a circle with centre $(a,b)$ and radius $r$.
- **Midpoint**: Point halfway between two given points $\bigl(\tfrac{x_1+x_2}{2},\tfrac{y_1+y_2}{2}\bigr)$.
- **Normal**: Line perpendicular to a curve at a given point.
- **Benchmark**: Standard or point of reference for comparison.

## Core Explanations
- Deriving the straight-line equation in slope–intercept form $y=mx+c$ and using point–gradient form $y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$.
- Distance formula $\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}$ and its use in proving collinearity or finding the radius of a circle.
- Condition for perpendicular lines: product of gradients $m_1m_2=-1$.
- Finding the equation of the tangent or normal to a curve $y=f(x)$ at a given point using calculus to determine the slope $f'(x)$.
- Solving simultaneous equations involving the line and circle to find points of intersection and determine whether a line is a tangent.
- Apply principles in realistic contexts such as laboratory experiments.

## Worked Examples
1. *Line equation*: Find the equation of the line through (2,3) with gradient 4.
   - $y-3=4(x-2) \Rightarrow y=4x-5$.
2. *Circle centre*: Determine the centre and radius of $x^2+y^2-4x+6y-12=0$.
   - Rearranging $(x^2-4x)+(y^2+6y)=12$ ⇒ $(x-2)^2+(y+3)^2=25$, so centre $(2,-3)$ and radius 5.
3. *Tangent problem*: Find the equation of the tangent to the circle $(x-3)^2+(y+1)^2=10$ at point (6,2).
   - Gradient of radius to (6,2) is $\tfrac{2+1}{6-3}=1$. Tangent gradient is -1. Therefore equation is $y-2=-1(x-6)$ ⇒ $y=-x+8$.

4. *Practice problem*: Use this problem to check your understanding of the theory.
   - Solution steps should include reasoning and final answer with units.

## Exam Tips
- When finding equations of tangents, differentiate the curve first to obtain the gradient at the point of contact.
- Show full working when completing the square to rewrite circle equations.
- Check whether the discriminant is zero to confirm if a line just touches a circle (tangent) or cuts it.
- Review past papers to identify common question patterns.

## Common Pitfalls
- Sign errors in the point–gradient form or when rearranging to slope–intercept form.
- Forgetting to square the radius when substituting into the circle equation or solving for intersection points.
- Misinterpreting the coordinates of the midpoint when negative values are involved.
- Overlooking units when substituting values into formulas.
