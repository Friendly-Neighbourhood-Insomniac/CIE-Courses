# Work Energy and Power

## Learning Objectives
- Apply the workâ€“energy principle \(W=\Delta E_k\).
- Calculate gravitational potential energy change \(mgh\) and mechanical power \(P=Fv\).
- Use conservation of energy in solving dynamics problems.

## Key Terminology
- **Work**: Energy transferred when a force moves its point of application.
- **Energy**: Capacity for doing work, measured in joules.
- **Power**: Rate at which work is done or energy is transferred.

## Core Explanations
Work done by a constant force is the product of force and displacement in the direction of the force.  Energy can be transferred between kinetic and potential forms.  Power measures the rate of energy transfer and is often expressed in watts.

## Worked Examples
1. *Lifting a weight*: Find the work done and power output when a 20 kg mass is raised 3 m in 4 s.
2. *Energy conservation*: Calculate the speed of a block sliding down a frictionless track using loss in potential energy.
