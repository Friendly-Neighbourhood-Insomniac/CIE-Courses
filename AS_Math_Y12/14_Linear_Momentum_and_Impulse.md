# Linear Momentum and Impulse

## Learning Objectives
- Apply conservation of linear momentum in collisions and explosions.
- Calculate impulse as the change in momentum \(Ft=\Delta mv\).
- Use coefficient of restitution to model impacts.

## Key Terminology
- **Momentum**: Product of mass and velocity of a body.

## Core Explanations
Momentum is a vector quantity \(p=mv\).  In a closed system total momentum is constant.  Impulse is the product of force and time and equals the change in momentum.  The coefficient of restitution relates the speeds of separation and approach in a collision.

## Worked Examples
1. *One-dimensional collision*: Two particles collide and rebound; find their speeds after impact using momentum conservation and restitution.
2. *Impulse of a force*: Determine the average force exerted by a bat on a ball given the change in velocity and contact time.
