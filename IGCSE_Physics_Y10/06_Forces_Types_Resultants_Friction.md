## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Describe common contact and non-contact forces.
- Determine the resultant of several forces.
- Explain how friction affects motion.

## 🔑 Key Terms
- **Force**
- **Resultant**
- **Friction**

## 📘 Core Explanation
This section summarises the main principles of the topic with reference to the CIE syllabus.

## 🧮 Worked Example 1
**Q:** Two forces of 4 N and 3 N act at right angles. Find the resultant.

**A:** Resultant = 5 N

## 🧮 Worked Example 2
**Q:** A 5 kg object experiences a resultant force of 15 N. Calculate its acceleration.

**A:** a = 3 m/s²

## 💡 Exam Tips
- Always show your working and include units.
- Write answers to an appropriate number of significant figures.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls
- Mixing up related quantities or using inconsistent units.
- Forgetting vector directions where applicable.
