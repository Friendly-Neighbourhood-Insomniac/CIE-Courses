## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Classify quantities as scalars or vectors.
- Resolve vectors into perpendicular components.
- Add vectors using diagrammatic methods.

## 🔑 Key Terms
- **Scalar**
- **Vector**
- **Resultant**

## 📘 Core Explanation
- Scalars have magnitude only (e.g., mass, temperature) while vectors include direction (e.g., velocity, force).
- Vector addition can be done graphically using a scale diagram or analytically using components.
- Resolving a vector into perpendicular components simplifies many calculations.

## 🧮 Worked Example 1
**Q:** Two displacements of 3 m east and 4 m north combine to give?

**A:** Resultant = 5 m at 53°

## 🧮 Worked Example 2
**Q:** Resolve a 10 N force at 30° to the horizontal.

**A:** Horizontal component = 8.7 N

## 💡 Exam Tips
- Always show your working and include units.
- Write answers to an appropriate number of significant figures.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls
- Mixing up related quantities or using inconsistent units.
- Forgetting vector directions where applicable.
