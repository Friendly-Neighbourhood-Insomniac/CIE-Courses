# Scalars And Vectors

## Learning Objectives
- Define scalar and vector quantities with examples.
- Add vectors graphically using the triangle method.
- Resolve a vector into horizontal and vertical components.

## Key Terminology
- **Concept**: Key idea related to the topic.

## Core Explanations
Scalars have magnitude only, while vectors have both magnitude and direction.  Vector addition can be carried out by drawing them head to tail.  Components along perpendicular axes allow easier calculations in two dimensions.

## Worked Examples
1. *Vector addition*: Determine the resultant of a 6 N force east and 8 N force north.
2. *Resolving components*: Find the horizontal and vertical components of a 10 N force at 40Â° to the horizontal.

## Exam Tips
- Check units carefully when substituting numbers into equations.
- Show intermediate steps to gain method marks.

## Common Pitfalls
- Misreading the question or forgetting to convert units can cause errors.
