## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Construct ray diagrams for simple optical systems.
- Explain colour filtering and mixing.
- Describe dispersion of white light.

## 🔑 Key Terms
- **Ray diagram**
- **Filter**
- **Dispersion**

## 📘 Core Explanation
- Ray diagrams trace the path of light through lenses and mirrors to show image formation.
- Colour filters absorb some wavelengths and transmit others, altering the appearance of objects.
- Combining red, green, and blue light produces white light (additive colour mixing).

## 🧮 Worked Example 1
**Q:** An object 10 cm from a mirror with f=5 cm forms an image where?

**A:** At 10 cm behind the mirror.

## 🧮 Worked Example 2
**Q:** Which filter transmits only red light?

**A:** A red filter

## 💡 Exam Tips
- Always show your working and include units.
- Write answers to an appropriate number of significant figures.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls
- Mixing up related quantities or using inconsistent units.
- Forgetting vector directions where applicable.
