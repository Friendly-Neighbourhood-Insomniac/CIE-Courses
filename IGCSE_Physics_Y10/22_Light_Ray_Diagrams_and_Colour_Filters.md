# Light Ray Diagrams And Colour Filters

## Learning Objectives
- Draw ray diagrams for mirrors and lenses.
- Use colour filters to absorb or transmit light of selected wavelengths.
- Explain primary and secondary colour mixing.

## Key Terminology
- **Concept**: Key idea related to the topic.

## Core Explanations
Ray diagrams show the paths light takes when it reflects or refracts. Colour filters work by absorbing certain wavelengths while transmitting others. Combining red, green and blue light produces secondary colours.

## Worked Examples
1. *Lens diagram*: Draw the image formation by a converging lens for an object beyond 2F.
2. *Filter application*: Determine the colour transmitted when white light passes through a blue then yellow filter.

## Exam Tips
- Check units carefully when substituting numbers into equations.
- Show intermediate steps to gain method marks.

## Common Pitfalls
- Misreading the question or forgetting to convert units can cause errors.
