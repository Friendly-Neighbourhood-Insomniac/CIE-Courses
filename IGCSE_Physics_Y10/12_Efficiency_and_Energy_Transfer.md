# Efficiency and Energy Transfer

## Learning Objectives
- Calculate efficiency using \(\frac{\text{useful energy}}{\text{input energy}}\times100\%\).
- Interpret energy transfer diagrams.
- Suggest methods to reduce energy losses.

## Key Terminology
- **Energy**: Capacity for doing work, measured in joules.

## Core Explanations
Not all input energy to a device becomes useful output; some is wasted as heat, sound or light. Efficiency is a ratio of useful output to input. Improving efficiency often involves reducing friction or heat loss.

## Worked Examples
1. *Power station*: If a station produces 200 MJ of electrical energy from 500 MJ of fuel, calculate its efficiency.
2. *Reducing losses*: Explain how insulation improves the efficiency of a house heating system.

## Exam Tips
- Check units carefully when substituting numbers into equations.
- Show intermediate steps to gain method marks.

## Common Pitfalls
- Misreading the question or forgetting to convert units can cause errors.
