## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Define melting, boiling and sublimation.
- Use Q = mL for phase change calculations.
- Describe energy changes at constant temperature.

## 🔑 Key Terms
- **Latent heat**
- **Melting**
- **Boiling**

## 📘 Core Explanation
This section summarises the main principles of the topic with reference to the CIE syllabus.

## 🧮 Worked Example 1
**Q:** Energy needed to melt 0.1 kg of ice (Lf=334 kJ/kg).

**A:** Q = 33.4 kJ

## 🧮 Worked Example 2
**Q:** How much energy to boil 0.05 kg of water (Lv=2.26 MJ/kg)?

**A:** Q = 113 kJ

## 💡 Exam Tips
- Always show your working and include units.
- Write answers to an appropriate number of significant figures.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls
- Mixing up related quantities or using inconsistent units.
- Forgetting vector directions where applicable.
