# Pressure and Ideal Gas Law

## Learning Objectives
- Describe states of matter in terms of the kinetic particle model.
- Explain heat transfer by conduction, convection and radiation with examples.
- Solve problems involving specific heat capacity and specific latent heat.
- Interpret heating and cooling curves for changes of state.
- Use interactive simulations to reinforce understanding of concepts.

## Key Terminology
- **Temperature**: Measure of average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance.
- **Specific heat capacity**: Energy required to raise 1 kg of a material by 1\,°C.
- **Latent heat**: Energy absorbed or released during a phase change at constant temperature.
- **Thermal conductivity**: Property of a material describing how well it conducts heat.
- **Benchmark**: Standard or point of reference for comparison.

## Core Explanations
- Particle arrangements in solids, liquids, and gases and how they relate to energy.
- Mechanisms of conduction through collisions, convection currents in fluids, and emission of thermal radiation.
- Using $Q=mc\Delta T$ to calculate temperature changes, and $Q=mL$ for phase changes.
- Analysis of cooling curves to identify melting and boiling points.
- Apply principles in realistic contexts such as laboratory experiments.

## Worked Examples
1. *Heating water*: Calculate the energy needed to heat 0.5 kg of water from 20\,°C to 60\,°C (c=4200 J/kg°C).
   - $Q=0.5\times4200\times40=84,000\,\text{J}$.
2. *Cooling metal*: A 0.3 kg piece of iron cools from 150\,°C to 20\,°C (c=450 J/kg°C). Find the heat lost.
   - $Q=0.3\times450\times130=17,550\,\text{J}$.
3. *Melting ice*: How much energy is required to melt 200 g of ice (L=334,000 J/kg)?
   - $Q=0.2\times334,000=66,800\,\text{J}$.

4. *Practice problem*: Use this problem to check your understanding of the theory.
   - Solution steps should include reasoning and final answer with units.

## Exam Tips
- Distinguish clearly between internal energy, thermal energy, and temperature.
- During phase changes, remember temperature remains constant while energy is absorbed or released.
- Quote data values (specific heat capacity or latent heat) in calculations with units.
- Review past papers to identify common question patterns.

## Common Pitfalls
- Mixing up the units for specific heat capacity (J/kg°C) and latent heat (J/kg).
- Assuming radiation requires particles—remember it travels through a vacuum.
- Forgetting mass must be in kilograms when using $Q=mc\Delta T$ or $Q=mL$.
- Overlooking units when substituting values into formulas.
