## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Apply pressure = force/area.
- Describe Brownian motion evidence for molecules.
- Use pV/T = constant for a fixed mass of gas.

## 🔑 Key Terms
- **Pressure**
- **Molecule**
- **pV = constant**

## 📘 Core Explanation
- Pressure in a fluid is force per unit area and increases with depth: P=ρgh.
- For a fixed amount of gas, pV/T is constant (ideal gas equation).
- Rising temperature at constant volume causes pressure to increase due to more energetic collisions.

## 🧮 Worked Example 1
**Q:** A force of 30 N acts on area 0.5 m². Find the pressure.

**A:** p = 60 Pa

## 🧮 Worked Example 2
**Q:** Gas at 300 K has volume 2 m³. What is the volume at 400 K if pressure is constant?

**A:** V₂ = 2 × 400/300 = 2.67 m³

## 💡 Exam Tips
- Always show your working and include units.
- Write answers to an appropriate number of significant figures.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls
- Mixing up related quantities or using inconsistent units.
- Forgetting vector directions where applicable.
