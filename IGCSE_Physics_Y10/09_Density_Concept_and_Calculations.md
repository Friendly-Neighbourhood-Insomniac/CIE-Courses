# Density Concept and Calculations

## Learning Objectives
- Define density as mass divided by volume.
- Measure volume of irregular objects using displacement.
- Perform density calculations for solids and liquids.

## Key Terminology
- **Density**: Mass per unit volume.

## Core Explanations
Density \(\rho=\frac{m}{V}\) is a property of materials. The volume of an irregular solid can be found by water displacement. Comparing densities helps predict whether an object will float or sink.

## Worked Examples
1. *Regular solid*: Calculate the density of a metal cube of side 3 cm and mass 81 g.
2. *Irregular solid*: Determine the density of a stone using a measuring cylinder and balance.
