## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Measure mass and volume to find density.
- Use the formula density = mass/volume.
- Explain why some objects float while others sink.

## 🔑 Key Terms
- **Density**
- **Mass**
- **Volume**

## 📘 Core Explanation
- Density is defined as mass per unit volume: ρ = m/V.
- Irregular solid volumes may be found by displacement of water in a measuring cylinder.
- Comparing densities explains why objects float or sink.

## 🧮 Worked Example 1
**Q:** A block of mass 0.5 kg occupies 2 ×10^-4 m³. Calculate its density.

**A:** ρ = 2500 kg/m³

## 🧮 Worked Example 2
**Q:** Find the mass of 1.2 L of oil of density 900 kg/m³.

**A:** m = 1.08 kg

## 💡 Exam Tips
- Always show your working and include units.
- Write answers to an appropriate number of significant figures.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls
- Mixing up related quantities or using inconsistent units.
- Forgetting vector directions where applicable.
