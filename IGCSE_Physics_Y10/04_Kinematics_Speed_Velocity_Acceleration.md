Topic: Kinematics speed velocity acceleration
-->

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Determine speed, velocity and acceleration from data.
- Apply equations of motion for constant acceleration.
- Interpret displacement- and velocity-time graphs.

## 🔑 Key Terms
- **Speed**
- **Velocity**
- **Acceleration**

## 📘 Core Explanation
This section summarises the main principles of the topic with reference to the CIE syllabus.

## 🧮 Worked Example 1
**Q:** A car travels 200 m in 10 s. What is its average speed?

**A:** v = 20 m/s

## 🧮 Worked Example 2
**Q:** A bus accelerates from 10 m/s to 22 m/s in 6 s. Find its acceleration.

**A:** a = 2 m/s²

## 💡 Exam Tips
- Always show your working and include units.
- Write answers to an appropriate number of significant figures.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls
- Mixing up related quantities or using inconsistent units.
- Forgetting vector directions where applicable.
