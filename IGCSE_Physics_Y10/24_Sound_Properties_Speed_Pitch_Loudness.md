## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Explain how sound waves are produced and propagate.
- Relate frequency to pitch and amplitude to loudness.
- Determine the speed of sound experimentally.

## 🔑 Key Terms
- **Pitch**
- **Loudness**
- **Echo**

## 📘 Core Explanation
This section summarises the main principles of the topic with reference to the CIE syllabus.

## 🧮 Worked Example 1
**Q:** Echo returns in 0.3 s from a wall 50 m away. Speed of sound?

**A:** ≈333 m/s

## 🧮 Worked Example 2
**Q:** If frequency increases, how does the pitch change?

**A:** Pitch becomes higher.

## 💡 Exam Tips
- Always show your working and include units.
- Write answers to an appropriate number of significant figures.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls
- Mixing up related quantities or using inconsistent units.
- Forgetting vector directions where applicable.
