# Sound Properties Speed Pitch Loudness

## Learning Objectives
- Explain how sound travels as longitudinal waves.
- Relate pitch to frequency and loudness to amplitude.
- Measure sound speed using time-of-flight techniques.

## Key Terminology
- **Speed**: Distance travelled per unit time, measured in metres per second.

## Core Explanations
Sound requires a medium and propagates as successive compressions and rarefactions. Higher frequency means higher pitch, while greater amplitude means louder sound. The speed of sound in air is about 340 m/s and can be measured with echoes.

## Worked Examples
1. *Echo method*: Measure the distance to a cliff using the time delay of an echo.
2. *Pitch change*: Compare the frequencies of notes C4 and C5 to discuss octave relationships.

## Exam Tips
- Check units carefully when substituting numbers into equations.
- Show intermediate steps to gain method marks.

## Common Pitfalls
- Misreading the question or forgetting to convert units can cause errors.
