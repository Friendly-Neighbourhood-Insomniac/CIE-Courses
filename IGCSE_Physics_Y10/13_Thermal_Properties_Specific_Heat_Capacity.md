## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Describe experiments to measure specific heat capacity.
- Solve problems using Q = mcΔT.
- Interpret heating and cooling curves.

## 🔑 Key Terms
- **Specific heat capacity**
- **Thermal energy**
- **Temperature**

## 📘 Core Explanation
- Specific heat capacity (c) is the energy required to raise 1 kg of a substance by 1 °C.
- The heat supplied is calculated by Q=mcΔT.
- Materials with high c, like water, require large amounts of energy to warm up.

## 🧮 Worked Example 1
**Q:** How much energy is needed to heat 0.2 kg of water by 30°C?

**A:** Q = 25200 J

## 🧮 Worked Example 2
**Q:** 5000 J heats 0.1 kg of copper (c=390 J/kg°C). Find the temperature rise.

**A:** ΔT ≈ 128°C

## 💡 Exam Tips
- Always show your working and include units.
- Write answers to an appropriate number of significant figures.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls
- Mixing up related quantities or using inconsistent units.
- Forgetting vector directions where applicable.
