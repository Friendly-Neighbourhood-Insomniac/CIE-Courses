## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Sketch typical distance-time and velocity-time graphs.
- Find acceleration from gradients of graphs.
- Calculate displacement from the area under velocity-time graphs.

## 🔑 Key Terms
- **Displacement**
- **Gradient**
- **Area**

## 📘 Core Explanation
This section summarises the main principles of the topic with reference to the CIE syllabus.

## 🧮 Worked Example 1
**Q:** From a velocity-time graph, the speed rises steadily to 8 m/s in 4 s. What is the acceleration?

**A:** a = 2 m/s²

## 🧮 Worked Example 2
**Q:** A car travels at 3 m/s for 10 s. Find the distance from the area under the graph.

**A:** s = 30 m

## 💡 Exam Tips
- Always show your working and include units.
- Write answers to an appropriate number of significant figures.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls
- Mixing up related quantities or using inconsistent units.
- Forgetting vector directions where applicable.
