# Motion Graphs DistanceTime VelocityTime

## Learning Objectives
- Interpret distance–time and velocity–time graphs.
- Determine gradients to find speed or acceleration.
- Use area under a velocity–time graph to calculate displacement.

## Key Terminology
- **Concept**: Key idea related to the topic.

## Core Explanations
The slope of a distance–time graph represents speed, while the slope of a velocity–time graph gives acceleration. The area under a velocity–time graph equals the distance travelled. Graph shapes reveal whether motion is uniform or changing.

## Worked Examples
1. *Finding acceleration*: From a velocity–time graph where velocity increases linearly from 0 to 20 m/s in 4 s, calculate the acceleration.
2. *Distance from graph*: Determine the total displacement of an object that travels with a triangular velocity–time profile.
