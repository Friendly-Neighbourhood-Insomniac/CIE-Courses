# Reflection and Refraction

## Learning Objectives
- Apply the law of reflection \(i=r\).
- Use Snell's law \(n_1\sin i=n_2\sin r\) for refraction.
- Describe effects such as total internal reflection.

## Key Terminology
- **Concept**: Key idea related to the topic.

## Core Explanations
Reflection occurs when a wave bounces off a surface; the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. Refraction is the change in direction of a wave passing between media of different densities, governed by Snell's law.

## Worked Examples
1. *Snell's law*: A light ray enters glass at 30Â°. If the refractive index is 1.5, find the angle of refraction.
2. *Total internal reflection*: Determine the critical angle for light going from water \(n=1.33\) to air.
