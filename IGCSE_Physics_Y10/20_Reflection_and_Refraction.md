## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- State and apply the law of reflection.
- Use Snell's law for refraction at a boundary.
- Draw ray diagrams for mirrors and lenses.

## 🔑 Key Terms
- **Incident ray**
- **Refraction**
- **Refractive index**

## 📘 Core Explanation
This section summarises the main principles of the topic with reference to the CIE syllabus.

## 🧮 Worked Example 1
**Q:** A ray strikes a mirror at 30° to the normal. Angle of reflection?

**A:** 30°

## 🧮 Worked Example 2
**Q:** Light enters glass (n=1.5) at 20° to the normal. Find angle of refraction.

**A:** ≈13°

## 💡 Exam Tips
- Always show your working and include units.
- Write answers to an appropriate number of significant figures.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls
- Mixing up related quantities or using inconsistent units.
- Forgetting vector directions where applicable.
