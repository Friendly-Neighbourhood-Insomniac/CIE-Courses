# Measurement Techniques And Uncertainties

## Learning Objectives
- Use common measuring devices such as rulers and stopwatches accurately.
- Distinguish between random and systematic errors.
- Estimate measurement uncertainty and express it as a percentage.

## Key Terminology
- **Concept**: Key idea related to the topic.

## Core Explanations
Precision is improved by repeating readings and averaging. Uncertainties in measurements combine when quantities are multiplied or divided. Significant figures should reflect the precision of the raw data.

## Worked Examples
1. *Stopwatch timing*: Measure the period of a pendulum over 20 oscillations and calculate the uncertainty in the period.
2. *Percentage error*: Determine the density of a metal block and estimate its percentage uncertainty from length and mass measurements.

## Exam Tips
- Check units carefully when substituting numbers into equations.
- Show intermediate steps to gain method marks.

## Common Pitfalls
- Misreading the question or forgetting to convert units can cause errors.
