## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Use vernier calipers and micrometers accurately.
- Calculate percentage uncertainty of measurements.
- Suggest ways to minimise systematic errors.

## 🔑 Key Terms
- **Uncertainty**
- **Systematic error**
- **Vernier scale**

## 📘 Core Explanation
- Use vernier calipers and micrometers to obtain precise readings.
- Percentage uncertainty equals absolute uncertainty divided by measured value times 100%.
- Repeated measurements and calibration reduce systematic errors.

## 🧮 Worked Example 1
**Q:** A length is measured as 5.0 cm ±0.1 cm. What is the percentage uncertainty?

**A:** 0.1/5.0 × 100 = 2%

## 🧮 Worked Example 2
**Q:** Add 2.0 ±0.1 m and 3.0 ±0.2 m.

**A:** 5.0 ±0.3 m

## 💡 Exam Tips
- Always show your working and include units.
- Write answers to an appropriate number of significant figures.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls
- Mixing up related quantities or using inconsistent units.
- Forgetting vector directions where applicable.
