# Electromagnetic Spectrum Properties and Uses

## Learning Objectives
- List the regions of the electromagnetic spectrum from radio to gamma rays.
- Describe common applications of each type of radiation.
- State hazards associated with high-frequency radiation.

## Key Terminology
- **Concept**: Key idea related to the topic.

## Core Explanations
All electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed in a vacuum but differ in frequency and wavelength. Uses range from radio communication to medical imaging. Excessive exposure to UV or gamma rays can damage living tissue.

## Worked Examples
1. *Ordering waves*: Arrange microwaves, X-rays and infrared in order of increasing frequency.
2. *Application*: Explain why gamma rays are used for sterilising medical equipment.

## Exam Tips
- Check units carefully when substituting numbers into equations.
- Show intermediate steps to gain method marks.

## Common Pitfalls
- Misreading the question or forgetting to convert units can cause errors.
