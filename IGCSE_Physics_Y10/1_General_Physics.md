# General Physics

## Learning Objectives
- Describe and measure physical quantities using SI units and prefixes.
- Analyse speed, velocity, and acceleration in linear motion problems.
- Apply Newton's laws to solve force and momentum questions.
- Calculate energy transfers, work, power, and pressure in different contexts.
- Use interactive simulations to reinforce understanding of concepts.

## Key Terminology
- **Displacement**: Straight-line distance in a given direction from start to finish.
- **Speed/Velocity**: Rate of change of distance/displacement with time.
- **Acceleration**: Change of velocity per unit time.
- **Momentum**: Product of mass and velocity of a moving object.
- **Force**: Push or pull acting on an object, causing acceleration.
- **Work**: Energy transferred when a force moves its point of application.
- **Benchmark**: Standard or point of reference for comparison.

## Core Explanations
- Converting between units (e.g. km/h to m/s) and using standard form.
- Interpreting motion graphs to determine displacement, velocity, and acceleration.
- Describing the effects of balanced and unbalanced forces, including friction and weight.
- Using $\text{momentum}=mv$ and the principle of conservation of momentum in collisions.
- Calculating mechanical energy changes, power output, and pressure in fluids.
- Apply principles in realistic contexts such as laboratory experiments.

## Worked Examples
1. *Acceleration from a velocity-time graph*: A cyclist increases speed from 2 m/s to 8 m/s in 3 s. Determine the acceleration.
   - $a=\frac{v-u}{t}=\frac{8-2}{3}=2\,\text{m/s}^2$.
2. *Momentum conservation*: Two trolleys of 0.5 kg and 0.8 kg collide. The first moves at 3 m/s, the second is stationary. Find their common velocity after sticking together.
   - $(0.5\times3+0.8\times0)=(0.5+0.8)v \Rightarrow v=1.15\,\text{m/s}$.
3. *Power calculation*: A motor lifts a 50 kg mass vertically 4 m in 5 s. Calculate the power output.
   - $W=mg\times h=50\times9.8\times4=1960\,\text{J};\ P=\frac{1960}{5}=392\,\text{W}$.

4. *Practice problem*: Use this problem to check your understanding of the theory.
   - Solution steps should include reasoning and final answer with units.

## Exam Tips
- Always state the correct SI unit with each numerical answer.
- Show clear steps when rearranging formulae.
- Use free-body diagrams to identify all forces acting on a body.
- Review past papers to identify common question patterns.

## Common Pitfalls
- Confusing weight (a force) with mass (a property of matter).
- Forgetting that velocity is a vector and requires a direction.
- Ignoring friction or air resistance when it is stated to be negligible.
- Overlooking units when substituting values into formulas.
