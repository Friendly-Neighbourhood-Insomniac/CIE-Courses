# Mass and Weight

## Learning Objectives
- Distinguish between mass and weight.
- Use \(W=mg\) to calculate the weight of an object.
- Understand gravitational field strength on different planets.

## Key Terminology
- **Mass**: Quantity of matter in an object, measured in kilograms.
- **Weight**: Force due to gravity acting on a mass.

## Core Explanations
Mass is a measure of the amount of matter and is constant everywhere. Weight is the gravitational force on a mass and depends on the local value of \(g\). Astronauts are weightless in orbit but their mass remains unchanged.

## Worked Examples
1. *Calculating weight*: Find the weight of a 2 kg object on Earth and on the Moon where \(g=1.6\,\text{m s}^{-2}\).
2. *Mass from weight*: Given a weight reading of 50 N, determine the mass of the object.
