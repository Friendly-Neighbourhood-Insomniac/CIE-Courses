## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Differentiate between mass and weight.
- Calculate weight using W = mg.
- Describe how weight varies with gravitational field strength.

## 🔑 Key Terms
- **Mass**
- **Weight**
- **Gravity**

## 📘 Core Explanation
- Mass is the amount of matter in a body and does not change with location.
- Weight is the gravitational force on a mass and is calculated using W=mg.
- On the Moon, weight is smaller because the gravitational field strength is less.

## 🧮 Worked Example 1
**Q:** Find the weight of a 4 kg mass on Earth.

**A:** W = 4 × 9.8 = 39.2 N

## 🧮 Worked Example 2
**Q:** Determine the mass of an object that weighs 30 N on Earth.

**A:** m = 30/9.8 ≈ 3.1 kg

## 💡 Exam Tips
- Always show your working and include units.
- Write answers to an appropriate number of significant figures.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls
- Mixing up related quantities or using inconsistent units.
- Forgetting vector directions where applicable.
