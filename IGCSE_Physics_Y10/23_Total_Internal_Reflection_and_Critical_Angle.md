Course: IGCSE Physics Year 10
Topic: Total internal reflection and critical angle
-->

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Define critical angle and total internal reflection.
- Calculate critical angle from refractive index.
- Describe applications in optical fibres.

## 🔑 Key Terms
- **Critical angle**
- **Total internal reflection**
- **Optical fibre**

## 📘 Core Explanation
This section summarises the main principles of the topic with reference to the CIE syllabus.

## 🧮 Worked Example 1
**Q:** Calculate the critical angle for glass of n=1.5.

**A:** ≈42°

## 🧮 Worked Example 2
**Q:** Why does light stay inside an optical fibre?

**A:** Because incidence exceeds the critical angle.

## 💡 Exam Tips
- Always show your working and include units.
- Write answers to an appropriate number of significant figures.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls
- Mixing up related quantities or using inconsistent units.
- Forgetting vector directions where applicable.
