# Total Internal Reflection And Critical Angle

## Learning Objectives
- Define the critical angle for a boundary between two media.
- Determine conditions for total internal reflection.
- Apply \(n=\tfrac{1}{\sin c}\) to calculate the critical angle.

## Key Terminology
- **Concept**: Key idea related to the topic.

## Core Explanations
When light travels from a denser to a less dense medium, the refracted ray bends away from the normal. Beyond a certain incident angle—the critical angle—refraction ceases and all the light is reflected internally.

## Worked Examples
1. *Calculating critical angle*: For glass of refractive index 1.5, find the critical angle with air.
2. *Optical fibre*: Explain why total internal reflection keeps light trapped inside a fibre optic cable.
