## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Calculate work done by a force.
- Relate work to energy transfer.
- Determine power from energy and time.

## 🔑 Key Terms
- **Work**
- **Energy**
- **Power**

## 📘 Core Explanation
- Work done equals force times distance moved in the direction of the force.
- Energy is transferred when work is done; power is the rate of energy transfer.
- Mechanical power can be calculated using P=Fv for constant speed situations.

## 🧮 Worked Example 1
**Q:** A 100 N force moves a box 5 m. Calculate the work done.

**A:** W = 500 J

## 🧮 Worked Example 2
**Q:** A 60 W bulb is on for 2 minutes. How much energy is used?

**A:** E = 7200 J

## 💡 Exam Tips
- Always show your working and include units.
- Write answers to an appropriate number of significant figures.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls
- Mixing up related quantities or using inconsistent units.
- Forgetting vector directions where applicable.
