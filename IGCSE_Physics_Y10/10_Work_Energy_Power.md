# Work Energy Power

## Learning Objectives
- Calculate work done using \(W=Fd\).
- Define power as \(P=\tfrac{W}{t}\) and convert between units.
- Apply the conservation of energy principle to simple systems.

## Key Terminology
- **Work**: Energy transferred when a force moves its point of application.
- **Energy**: Capacity for doing work, measured in joules.
- **Power**: Rate at which work is done or energy is transferred.

## Core Explanations
Work is the energy transferred when a force causes a displacement in its direction. Power measures the rate at which energy is converted. Energy cannot be created or destroyed but can change form, such as potential energy becoming kinetic energy.

## Worked Examples
1. *Power output*: Calculate the power of a motor that lifts a 10 kg mass 5 m in 8 s.
2. *Energy conversion*: Determine the kinetic energy gained by a 1 kg object falling 3 m ignoring air resistance.

## Exam Tips
- Check units carefully when substituting numbers into equations.
- Show intermediate steps to gain method marks.

## Common Pitfalls
- Misreading the question or forgetting to convert units can cause errors.
