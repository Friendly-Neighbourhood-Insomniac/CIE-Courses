Course: IGCSE Physics Year 10
Topic: Kinetic model of matter
-->

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Describe particle motion in solids, liquids and gases.
- Relate temperature to average kinetic energy.
- Explain gas pressure using the kinetic model.

## 🔑 Key Terms
- **Brownian motion**
- **Gas pressure**
- **Kinetic theory**

## 📘 Core Explanation
This section summarises the main principles of the topic with reference to the CIE syllabus.

## 🧮 Worked Example 1
**Q:** Why does the pressure of a gas increase when heated at constant volume?

**A:** Particles move faster and collide more often.

## 🧮 Worked Example 2
**Q:** If average molecular speed is 300 m/s at 300 K, estimate the speed at 600 K.

**A:** ≈ 424 m/s

## 💡 Exam Tips
- Always show your working and include units.
- Write answers to an appropriate number of significant figures.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls
- Mixing up related quantities or using inconsistent units.
- Forgetting vector directions where applicable.
