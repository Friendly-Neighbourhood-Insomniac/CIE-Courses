## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Distinguish base from derived SI units.
- Convert values using prefixes such as kilo and milli.
- Record measurements to an appropriate precision.

## 🔑 Key Terms
- **Quantity**
- **Base unit**
- **Prefix**

## 📘 Core Explanation
- SI base units include metre (m) for length, kilogram (kg) for mass, and second (s) for time.
- Derived units combine base units; for example, the newton (N) is kg·m/s².
- Prefixes such as kilo- (10^3) and milli- (10^-3) help express large or small values.

## 🧮 Worked Example 1
**Q:** Convert 2.5 km to metres.

**A:** 2.5 km = 2500 m

## 🧮 Worked Example 2
**Q:** Express 0.0037 m in millimetres.

**A:** 0.0037 m = 3.7 mm

## 💡 Exam Tips
- Always show your working and include units.
- Write answers to an appropriate number of significant figures.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls
- Mixing up related quantities or using inconsistent units.
- Forgetting vector directions where applicable.
