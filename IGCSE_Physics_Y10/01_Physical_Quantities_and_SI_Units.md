# Physical Quantities And Si Units

## Learning Objectives
- Recall base quantities and their SI units.
- Convert between multiples and submultiples using standard prefixes.
- Use appropriate units when expressing calculated values.

## Key Terminology
- **Concept**: Key idea related to the topic.

## Core Explanations
The SI system defines base units such as metre, kilogram and second. Prefixes like kilo-, milli- and mega- indicate powers of ten. Correct unit conversion is essential when substituting values into equations.

## Worked Examples
1. *Unit conversion*: Express 5 km in metres and centimetres.
2. *Prefix application*: Convert 0.02 MW to watts and to kilowatts.
