## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Explain expansion of solids, liquids and gases.
- Describe how thermometers measure temperature.
- Convert between Celsius and Kelvin scales.

## 🔑 Key Terms
- **Expansion**
- **Thermometer**
- **Temperature scale**

## 📘 Core Explanation
- Most materials expand when heated and contract when cooled.
- Thermometers rely on measurable physical changes, such as volume of mercury or resistance of a thermistor.
- Expansion joints in bridges accommodate dimensional changes with temperature.

## 🧮 Worked Example 1
**Q:** A thermometer thread expands 3 mm for a 30°C rise. How much for 10°C?

**A:** 1 mm

## 🧮 Worked Example 2
**Q:** Convert 20°C to Kelvin.

**A:** 293 K

## 💡 Exam Tips
- Always show your working and include units.
- Write answers to an appropriate number of significant figures.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls
- Mixing up related quantities or using inconsistent units.
- Forgetting vector directions where applicable.
