## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Describe diffraction around openings.
- Explain constructive and destructive interference.
- Relate interference patterns to path difference.

## 🔑 Key Terms
- **Diffraction**
- **Interference**
- **Fringe**

## 📘 Core Explanation
- Diffraction is the spreading of waves when they pass through a gap or around obstacles.
- Interference patterns form when two waves superpose, creating regions of constructive and destructive interference.
- Young’s double-slit experiment demonstrates light interference.

## 🧮 Worked Example 1
**Q:** Two slits separated by 0.1 mm are lit with 500 nm light on a 1 m screen. What is the fringe spacing?

**A:** 5 mm

## 🧮 Worked Example 2
**Q:** When does destructive interference occur?

**A:** When path difference equals half a wavelength.

## 💡 Exam Tips
- Always show your working and include units.
- Write answers to an appropriate number of significant figures.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls
- Mixing up related quantities or using inconsistent units.
- Forgetting vector directions where applicable.
