# Diffraction and Interference

## Learning Objectives
- Recognize diffraction patterns from apertures and obstacles.
- Understand constructive and destructive interference.
- Use the double-slit formula \(d\sin\theta=m\lambda\).

## Key Terminology
- **Concept**: Key idea related to the topic.

## Core Explanations
When waves pass through a narrow gap they spread out, an effect called diffraction. Interference occurs when two coherent waves overlap, producing bright and dark fringes. The spacing of fringes depends on wavelength, slit separation and distance to the screen.

## Worked Examples
1. *Fringe spacing*: Calculate the distance between interference fringes for light of wavelength 600 nm passing through slits 0.5 mm apart onto a screen 1 m away.
2. *Single-slit diffraction*: Explain how the width of the central maximum changes with slit width.

- Show intermediate steps to gain method marks.

## Common Pitfalls
- Misreading the question or forgetting to convert units can cause errors.
