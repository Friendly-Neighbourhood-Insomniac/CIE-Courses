# Kinetic and Potential Energy

## Learning Objectives
- Calculate kinetic energy using \(E_k=\tfrac{1}{2}mv^2\).
- Calculate gravitational potential energy change using \(E_p=mgh\).
- Apply conservation of energy to moving objects.

## Key Terminology
- **Energy**: Capacity for doing work, measured in joules.

## Core Explanations
Objects in motion possess kinetic energy proportional to the square of their speed. Gravitational potential energy depends on height in a gravitational field. When friction is negligible, the total mechanical energy remains constant.

## Worked Examples
1. *Pendulum swing*: Calculate the speed of a pendulum bob at its lowest point given its height above that point.
2. *Car braking*: Find the kinetic energy lost when a car of mass 800 kg slows from 20 m/s to rest.

## Exam Tips
- Check units carefully when substituting numbers into equations.
- Show intermediate steps to gain method marks.

## Common Pitfalls
- Misreading the question or forgetting to convert units can cause errors.
