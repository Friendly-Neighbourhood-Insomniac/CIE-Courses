Course: IGCSE Physics Year 10
Topic: Kinetic and potential energy
-->

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Use KE = 1/2 m v^2 and GPE = mgh.
- Convert between kinetic and potential energy.
- Apply conservation of energy to simple systems.

## 🔑 Key Terms
- **Kinetic energy**
- **Potential energy**
- **Conservation**

## 📘 Core Explanation
This section summarises the main principles of the topic with reference to the CIE syllabus.

## 🧮 Worked Example 1
**Q:** Find the kinetic energy of a 0.5 kg ball moving at 8 m/s.

**A:** KE = 16 J

## 🧮 Worked Example 2
**Q:** What is the gravitational potential energy of a 2 kg mass 3 m high?

**A:** GPE ≈ 59 J

## 💡 Exam Tips
- Always show your working and include units.
- Write answers to an appropriate number of significant figures.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls
- Mixing up related quantities or using inconsistent units.
- Forgetting vector directions where applicable.
