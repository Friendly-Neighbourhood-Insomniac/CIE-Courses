# Turning Effect Of Forces Moments Equilibrium

## Learning Objectives
- Calculate moments using \(\text{moment}=F\times d\).
- Apply the principle of moments for bodies in equilibrium.
- Describe how the centre of mass affects stability.

## Key Terminology
- **Concept**: Key idea related to the topic.

## Core Explanations
A moment is the turning effect of a force about a pivot. For an object in equilibrium the sum of clockwise moments equals the sum of anticlockwise moments. The stability of objects depends on the position of their centre of mass relative to the base.

## Worked Examples
1. *Seesaw problem*: Calculate the force required to balance a plank when a child sits at one end.
2. *Centre of mass*: Find the position of the centre of mass of a uniform ruler using a balancing method.
