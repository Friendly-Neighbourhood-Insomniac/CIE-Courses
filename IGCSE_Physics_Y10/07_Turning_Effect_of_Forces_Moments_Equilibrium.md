## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Define the moment of a force.
- Use the principle of moments for equilibrium problems.
- Describe uses of levers and simple machines.

## 🔑 Key Terms
- **Moment**
- **Pivot**
- **Equilibrium**

## 📘 Core Explanation
- A moment equals force multiplied by perpendicular distance from pivot.
- For an object in rotational equilibrium, the sum of clockwise moments equals the sum of anticlockwise moments.
- The centre of mass is the point where the mass of an object may be considered to act.

## 🧮 Worked Example 1
**Q:** What moment is produced by a 5 N force 0.2 m from a pivot?

**A:** Moment = 1 N m

## 🧮 Worked Example 2
**Q:** A 15 N child sits 1 m from a pivot. Where must a 20 N child sit on the opposite side to balance?

**A:** 20 x d = 15 x 1 ⇒ d = 0.75 m

## 💡 Exam Tips
- Always show your working and include units.
- Write answers to an appropriate number of significant figures.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls
- Mixing up related quantities or using inconsistent units.
- Forgetting vector directions where applicable.
