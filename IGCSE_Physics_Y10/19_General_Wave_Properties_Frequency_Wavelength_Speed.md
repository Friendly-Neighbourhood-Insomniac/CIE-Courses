# General Wave Properties Frequency Wavelength Speed

## Learning Objectives
- Use \(v=f\lambda\) to relate speed, frequency and wavelength.
- Describe wavefronts, crests and troughs.
- Distinguish between transverse and longitudinal waves.

## Key Terminology
- **Wave**: Disturbance transferring energy through space or a medium.
- **Frequency**: Number of oscillations per second of a wave.
- **Wavelength**: Distance between two consecutive identical points on a wave.

## Core Explanations
Waves transfer energy without transferring matter. For any wave, speed equals frequency multiplied by wavelength. Transverse waves oscillate perpendicular to travel direction, while longitudinal waves oscillate along the travel direction.

## Worked Examples
1. *Calculate frequency*: A wave travelling at 300 m/s with wavelength 0.5 m has what frequency?
2. *Identify wave type*: State whether sound in air is transverse or longitudinal and justify.

## Exam Tips
- Check units carefully when substituting numbers into equations.
- Show intermediate steps to gain method marks.

## Common Pitfalls
- Misreading the question or forgetting to convert units can cause errors.
