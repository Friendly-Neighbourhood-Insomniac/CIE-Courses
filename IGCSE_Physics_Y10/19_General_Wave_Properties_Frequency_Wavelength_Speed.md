Topic: General wave properties frequency wavelength speed
-->

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Define amplitude, frequency, period and wavelength.
- Use v = fλ to calculate wave speed.
- Distinguish between transverse and longitudinal waves.

## 🔑 Key Terms
- **Wavelength**
- **Frequency**
- **Amplitude**

## 📘 Core Explanation
This section summarises the main principles of the topic with reference to the CIE syllabus.

## 🧮 Worked Example 1
**Q:** A wave has frequency 50 Hz and wavelength 0.2 m. What is its speed?

**A:** v = 10 m/s

## 🧮 Worked Example 2
**Q:** If the period of a wave is 0.01 s, find its frequency.

**A:** f = 100 Hz

## 💡 Exam Tips
- Always show your working and include units.
- Write answers to an appropriate number of significant figures.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls
- Mixing up related quantities or using inconsistent units.
- Forgetting vector directions where applicable.
